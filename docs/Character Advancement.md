## Advancement Details

Below is the description of various character advancement aspects,

### Ability Score Advancement

At each level (including 1st) a character may allocate points into their ability scores as an inherent  bonus to represent their continued growth as a character. A character gains a point each level to add to his ability scores, as well as an additional point every even level, as an inherent bonus to his stats. This means a character at 1st level will have 1 point, while a character will have 30 points to allocate at level 20. A single ability score cannot have an inherent bonus to a single ability score for more than half the character's hit dice (rounded up).

### Save Allocation

In this system saving throws are determined by the player as they level, given a number of points to spend each level with a maximum value for each save. A character has a Reflex, Fortitude, and Will saving throw and must allocate points into it accordingly. At first level a character gains 4 points to spend amongst their 3 saving throws, with a maximum of 2 in a single save. At 2nd level and every level thereafter the character gains 2 points to allocate in their saving throws up to the maximum for each save. While detailed on the chart the formula for the maximum saving throw value for a single save is 2 + 3/4 of the character’s level. This maximum is simply the base save bonus your character has and does not limit other factors such as ability score modifiers, and other bonuses to saving throws.

## Feat Progression

Characters gain a basic progression as they level of Racial, Skill, any a category of any feat.

### Any Feats

A character gains a feat of any type they qualify for at every odd level (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc..). This type of feat can be any feat from Magic, Martial, Combat, Racial, Skill, or any other feat that the character meets the prerequisites for. Granting a character a total of 10 “Any” feats by 20th level.

### Skill Feats

Skill feats are gained at 1st, 5th, and every 5 levels thereafter (1, 5, 10, 15, 20) gaining a total of 5 skill feats by 20th level. These feats must always be selected from the skill feat category.

### Racial Feats

Racial feats are gained at 1st, 4th, and every 3 levels thereafter (1, 4, 7, 10, etc..) gaining a total of 7 racial feats by 20th level. These feats must always be selected from the racial feat category, either for your specific race/heritage, or the general race feats that can be taken by any race.

### Class Feat Progression

This is not included on the feat progression table as this progression is based on levels in classes rather than overall character; specifically type of class such as Martial, Magic, or Hybrid. Thus this is gained at the levels the sum total of your levels in that type of class reach the indicated amount.

Example: A character with 3 levels in martial classes and 3 levels in magic would have no bonus martial or magic feats from this. At their next level, taking a level in martial class would give them 4 levels in martial and 3 levels in magic, granting them their first martial feat. At the next level taking a level in a magic class would then grant them their first magic feat. Thus despite gaining it for 4 levels in a type of class, they gained these feats at 7th and 8th.

Example: A character with 2 levels in rogue and 2 levels in barbarian would have a single bonus martial feat as their total amount of martial classes would equal 4.

#### Martial Classes

A character gains a bonus martial feat for every 4 levels in a martial class they possess. Meaning a character in only martial classes would gain a bonus martial or stance feat at 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th. This does not matter what classes the character takes levels in, only as long as they are of the martial type. This does not count levels in hybrid classes.

#### Magic Classes

A character gains a bonus magic feat for every 4 levels in a magic class they possess. A character in only magic classes would gain a bonus magic feat at 4th, 8th, 12th, and 16th, and 20th. This does not matter what classes the character takes levels in, only as long as they are of the magic type. This does not count levels in hybrid classes.

#### Hybrid Classes

A character gains a bonus magic or martial feat for every 4 levels in a hybrid class they posses. A character in only hybrid classes would gain a bonus martial or magic feat at 4th, 8th, 12th, and 16th, and 20th. This does not matter what classes the character takes levels in, only as long as they are of the hybrid type. This does not count levels in magic or martial classes to determine this.

### Bonus Feats
As a character advances in level, they may gain bonus feats from class features or other sources. Unless otherwise specified, when a bonus feat is granted the character must meet all prerequisites for that feat; this does not change regardless of whether a specific feat is granted or if the character is allowed to select a feat (whether from a category such as martial feats, or a list of specific feats).

If a character is granted a specific feat (such as by the Rogue’s class feature which grants the Evasion feat), and the character already possesses that feat from another source (such as having chosen it on character creation or at level-up), the character may instead select a different feat in its place. The character must meet all prerequisites for this feat, and it must use the granted feat as a prerequisite; if no feats are available to select under these requirements the character may instead select a martial feat for which they meet the prerequisites, or may be allowed to select a different feat at the GM’s discretion. The source which grants this bonus feat may specify a different method of substitution, or deny substitution altogether.

### Experience Points Per Level

Experience points required per level depend on the campaign or GM. Some may choose to use Slow, medium or fast experience. Some may choose to even avoid experience entirely doing a milestone-based system.
