title: Perks
---
A character begins with a set of perks. These are unique features only granted at 1st level to help give a character the tools it needs to succeed without needing to be granted by a class. Perks primarily allow a character to use their ability scores in new ways from adjusting what stat governs a saving throw, to the stat used in melee attack rolls.

Drawbacks are also an option for characters; while being called drawbacks work similarly to perks but provide some sort of character-defining detriment alongside a much more powerful than usual bonus.

Perks and Drawbacks are both split into categories of Major and Minor. At 1st level a character begins with one Major Perk and Two Minor Perks; and may select a Single Major Drawback or up to two minor drawbacks. Characters may substitute perks with a drawback of similar category (major drawback for a major perk, minor drawback for a minor perk), but do not gain anything extra for doing so beyond the listed benefit for taking the drawback.

## Perks

Major perks tend to do a full conversion of an ability (such as changing will saves from focus to psyche); while minor perks tend to do a partial conversion (such as weapon finesse allowing agility for melee attack rolls, but still using strength for damage rolls). These can be more than expanding or replacing the usage of a stat but tend to be build-defining.

## Drawbacks

Drawbacks are character-defining traits that have both a positive and negative affect on your character. These may be taken in place of perks; marked individually as a major or minor drawback. Drawbacks are designed to have a negative impact on your character, but as a trade should give a benefit that either balances against the drawback or at least allows a character to cope with the drawback better than others. This is generally a system to facilitate thematics rather than allotting raw power to a character, but as the character is gaining benefits some restrictions do exist on this as well.

Characters are normally allotted 1 major drawback or 2 minor drawbacks in addition to their normal perk selections. These do not allow a character to take additional major or minor perks beyond their normal limits, and instead are taken in place of their listed type, major drawbacks in place of major perks and minor drawbacks in place of minor perks. A GM may allow a player to take more drawbacks beyond the normal allotment without needing to trade their perks.

| Procrastinator  | You have a knack for putting things off until later, and end up paying the price as a result. Pick an interaction that is important for your character approved by your GM; you have a 10% chance to have not done that task (such as forgetting to prepare that spell slot, buy arrows, reload your gun, etc..). This occurs when you attempt to perform an action related to that task (such as casting a spell, knocking an arrow, or firing your gun, etc…). The GM should help determine the type of action to ensure it is something that can occur somewhat commonly for the character. | You are such an adept procrastinator that all status conditions are delayed 1 round before affecting the character. This does not count against the duration of the status conditions but rather simply delays its onset by 1 round. Effects that can cleanse such status conditions may still affect the character and cleanse the status condition before it would apply. |

| Bulky                 | Your great bulk of body through either bone, muscle, or general corpulence makes it harder for you to get through some places. You take a -4 penalty on stealth checks and cannot squeeze into spaces smaller than your own without magical assistance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Due to your increased bulk you are more sturdy and gain 1 additional hit point per four character levels you possess and gain a +2 bonus to saves against grapple maneuvers.                                                                                                                   |
| Graceless             | You must make a DC 13 + ½ hit dice acrobatics check or fall prone in any round you move more than half your movement speed at the end of your movement. In addition you increase the AP cost of standing up from prone by 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | You reduce the penalties to AC and attack rolls for being prone by 2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Old Wound             | Inclimate weather (such as snow or rain) causes your old wounds to ache. During these types of weather you take a -5 penalty to your move speed and must make a DC 15 + ½ character level concentration check to cast spells during this time due to the aches and pains you feel.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | You are aware 24 hours in advance if the weather will become rainy or snowy as well as vaguely if it will be light or heavy rain/snow.                                                                                                                                                         |
| Packrat               | You must make a Mental save (DC 10 + ½ character level) anytime you wish to sell an item, or use a limited use resource (such as a potion). If you fail this save you must instead hold onto the item instead of selling or using it and may not attempt again for another 24 hours for that item.                                                                                                                                                                                   | You reduce the penalties for medium and heavy encumbrance to half their usual severity.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Short Legs            | Your legs are quite short for your race. Your movement speed is reduced by 10 (minimum 5).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Your lower center of gravity has made you harder to trip, granting you a +2 to saves against trip attempts. In addition your legs are more sturdy, allowing you to treat your strength score as 2 higher for the purposes of determining carrying capacity and your strength rating for armor. |
| Uncontrolled Strength | Your strength is too great and you have difficulty controlling it. Anytime you pick up or retrieve an object you have a 25% chance of dealing your strength modifier in damage against the object, ignoring a number of points of hardness of the object equal to half your hit dice (minimum 1).                                                                                                                                                                                    | You deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to half your strength modifier anytime you successfully grapple a creature.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Vertigo               | Anytime you’re above the ground such as through flying, or near a ledge you take a -4 penalty on acrobatics checks to fly and on all saving throws against fear effects. In addition you take a -2 penalty on athletics checks to jump across gaps with falls greater than 10 feet. If given the frightened or panicked condition you will attempt to flee from the source of fear, but will not attempt to go near a high ledge or fly to attempt to escape the source of the fear. | You gain a +2 morale bonus on climb checks and physical saves to catch yourself from falling.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Vice                  | You have a dependency on alcohol, smoking, or some similar thing that you may not have full addiction to, but still rely on to calm your nerves. You must spend at least 1 hour each day on one of these vices or take a -1 penalty on all rolls you make until you do.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | You gain a +1 morale bonus to all skill checks and attack rolls for 1 hour after partaking in your vice.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
