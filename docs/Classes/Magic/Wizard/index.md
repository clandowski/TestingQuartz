# Class Features

The following are class features of the Wizard.

## Weapon and Armor Proficiency

A wizard is proficient with daggers, light crossbows, heavy crossbows, and quarterstaffs.

## Casting

A wizard may combine spells and talents to create magical effects. A wizards casting style determines his casting ability modifier. In addition if this is the Wizard’s first level in a casting class he gains a single discipline feat he qualifies for, and may choose his <a href="/Magic%20Rules/Casting%20Type/">Casting Type</a>. (See Casting Type on the Magic page)

If this is the character’s first level in a class, he also gains the Ritual Casting Initiate (Magic) feat as a bonus feat.

## Caster’s Concentration

As a spellcaster, a Wizard gains ranks in the Concentration skill equal to his class level.

## Spell Pool

A wizard gains access to a magical source of energy known as a spell pool. This pool contains a number of spell points equal to his levels in casting classes + his casting ability modifier (minimum 1). This pool replenishes once per day after a long rest.

## Implements

A wizard may choose a staff, tome, or wand as his implement.

## Magic Talents

A Wizard gains 1 magic talent every level plus an additional talent every odd level after 1st, each magic talent may be used to learn a new talent or new spell the wizard qualifies for.

## Casting Style (Su)

A wizard defines himself partially through his casting style. At first level a wizard choses a casting style that matches his casting type. This also determines the wizard’s casting ability modifier.

|Casting Style|Prerequisite|Casting Ability Modifier|
|---|---|---|
|Traditionalist|Prepared Caster type|Intelligence|
|Arcanist|Spontaneous Caster type|Psyche|

## Dedicated Study (Su)

A wizard learns to specialize in a type of magic representing his focused study within that school of magic. At 1st level the wizard selects a single school of magic from the list of School Keywords (Such as Force, Evocation, Transmutation, or Polymorph).

If this is the character’s first level in a magic class, the wizard gains a single affinity talent of his choice and a single spell matching his chosen school of magic, he must otherwise meet all the prerequisites of the chosen spell. A wizard then chooses 2 opposing schools of magic.

The wizard gains additional benefits based on his chosen dedicated study. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter the wizard may treat his BCB and SPB as 1 higher for any spell he casts with a keyword matching his chosen school of magic.

The chosen opposition schools instead take a -1 penalty to BCB and SPB (to a minimum of 1) increasing by 1 at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.

At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter a wizard may choose an additional dedicated school but also gains one additional opposition school each time he does so. Alternatively instead of gaining a new dedicated school, the wizard may instead choose to remove one of his opposition schools instead.

## Arcane Reservoir (Su)

At 2nd level the wizard gains access to an additional pool of power known as an arcane reservoir. An arcane reservoir allows the wizard to fuel a number of abilities they possess. This arcane reservoir has a number of points equal to 1 + his casting ability modifier (minimum 3) and refreshes once per day when the wizard regains his spell points for the day. A wizard may spend 1 spell point to regain 3 points of his arcane reservoir.

A wizard may spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir as a reaction to grant himself a barrier of pure arcane energy, granting him a number of temporary hit points equal to his class level plus his casting ability modifier. These temporary hit points last 1 minute.

## Wizard Studies (Su)

At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter the wizard gains a wizard study.

## Signature Spell (Su)

At 3rd level the wizard designates a single spell as his Signature Spell. The selected spell must be one from his dedicated school of study. The wizard gains one of the following benefits based on his casting style.

- **Traditionalist**: The traditionalist wizard may prepare his signature spell without counting against his talents prepared for the day, but only for the spell itself and not talents associated with that spell. In addition, once per day when preparing a charge of the spell he may prepare one additional charge of the spell at no cost and it does not count against his spell charge limit.
- **Arcanist**: Once per day the wizard may reduce the cost of a single meta talent he is applying to his signature spell by 1 (minimum 0).

At 7th level and every 7 levels thereafter, the wizard gains an additional signature spell.

## School Specialization (Su)

At 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter,, the wizard learns to draw additional power from his schools of magic gaining one of the following benefits; if a selection has a listed school of magic the selection must match his dedicated study:

## Meta Reservoir (Su)

At 11th level, the wizard learns to expand the power of his arcane reservoir. The wizard may 2 spend points from his arcane reservoir pool in place of a spell point cost incurred from a meta talent.

## Brilliant Intellect (Su)

At 19th level, the wizard gains additional prowess in their capacity for magic determined by their casting type:

- **Traditionalist**: The wizard gains an additional two slots for spells and talents when preparing their spells. This does not grant the wizard additional spell charges.
- **Arcanist**: The wizard gains two additional spells or talents of their choice to be added to their known talents.

## Archmage (Su)

At 20th level, the wizard becomes a master of the arcane and learns to be prepared no matter the situation. The wizard gains the following benefit determined by his casting type:

- **Traditionalist**: Once per day as a 4 AP action the wizard may swap any number of talents or spells and unexpended charges with new ones from his spell source. Unexpended charges swapped in this way return their unspent spell points to be assembled into new spell charges. The wizard may use this an additional time per day if he possesses the quick study wizard study.
- **Arcanist**: A number of times per day equal to the wizard’s casting ability modifier the wizard may spend a point from his arcane reservoir as a reaction to gain access to a single spell or talent he qualifies for but does not know. The wizard retains the benefit of this talent for a number of rounds equal to his wizard level. Once the duration is up any benefits granted, or spells currently ongoing with the talent immediately end.
