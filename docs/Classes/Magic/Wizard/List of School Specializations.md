| Anchoring Magicks     | Rift                       | Whenever a creature attempts to teleport or summon a creature within 30 feet of you, you may attempt to block the effect. Make an opposed SPB check against the spell, using your SPB for Rift magic, as a reaction by spending a spell point. If successful this is treated as if the wizard had successfully used the counterspell talent of dispel magic against the target spell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Construct Control     | Creation and Enchantment   | Your mind-affecting spells may now affect constructs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Endless Magics        | Transmutation, Wizard 13th | The wizard’s transmutation spells automatically gain the benefits of the extend spell meta talent without adjusting the spell point cost of the spell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Esoteric Enchantments | Enchantment, Wizard 13th   | Your enchantment spells with mind-affecting abilities bypass any immunities to mind-effect effects, even if the creature would be immune from having a 0 intelligence. If you possess the undead mentality or construct control specializations, you gain an additional +2 to your save attack rolls against creatures of that type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Explosion             | Evocation, Wizard 13th     | You may apply the Widen Spell meta talent without adjusting the spell point cost of evocation spells you cast. If the spell can only target a single creature you may instead choose to add your wizard level to the damage of the spell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Heroic Undead         | Necromancy, Wizard 13th    | Your risen undead retain much more of their original self to the point it's difficult to determine their undead nature. Undead summoned by you retain 1 additional feat or ability they had from when they were alive and have a 5 intelligence. In addition your undead may speak normally. You may choose to allow your undead to look nearly alive, rather than decayed, requiring creatures to make a sense motive check against 15+ your wizard level to spot if they’re undead. If your undead possess intelligent undead they improve their intelligence to 10 or their intelligence score from when they were alive (whichever is higher). |
| Lasting Creations     | Creation                   | Objects created by the wizard’s conjuration spells gain an additional 2 hit points per wizard level. If the object or effect created does not have hit points it instead gains a +4 bonus against any attempts to dispel it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Mind to Body          | Polymorph, Wizard 13th     | When casting a Polymorph spell on yourself, you may choose to temporarily exchange your Casting Ability Score (usually Intelligence or Psyche) with one of your physical ability scores (Strength, Agility, or Endurance). For the duration of the effect your attributes are altered to the new value, recalculating attack, defense, and other effects as normal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Natural Summoner      | Conjuration                | The wizard reduces the action required to concentrate on his conjuration spells by 1 AP; if this reduces the concentration time to 0 it instead is able to be concentrated on as a reaction. Concentrating as a reaction must be done only once per round at the start of the wizard's turn. In addition the wizard may roll twice and take the higher result on any concentration checks needed to continue concentration on a conjuration spell.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Permanent Creations   | Creation, Wizard 13th      | The wizard may spend 3 additional spell points when casting a creation spell to change the duration to Permanent but the spell remains dispellable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Persistent Changes    | Transmutation              | Any transmutation spell cast upon an ally lasts one additional round per 4 wizard levels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Persuasive            | Enhancement                | You may roll a bluff check against a creature’s sense motive when casting an enchantment spell upon a creature. On a success the creature is not immediately aware you have cast an enchantment spell upon them, though this does not prevent any doubt or confusion from a creature when the enchantment spell ends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Potent Magics         | Evocation                  | You may add half your wizard level to the damage roll of any evocation spell you cast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Powerful Summoner     | Conjuration, Wizard 13th   | The wizard treats his BCB as 5 higher for determining the duration of any of his conjuration spells. If a spell already would last 24 hours or more he may instead reduce the spell point cost of the spell by 2 (minimum 0)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Resilient Illusions   | Illusion                   | You may roll twice and take the better result on your save attack rolls with illusion spells.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
