# Class Features

The following are class features of the sorcerer.

## Weapon and Armor Proficiency

Sorcerers are proficient with all simple weapons and simple light armor.

## Casting

A sorcerer may combine spells and talents to create magical effects, and uses his choice of Intelligence or Psyche as his Casting Ability Modifier. In addition if this is the sorcerer ’s first level in a casting class he gains a single discipline feat he qualifies for, and may choose his <a href="/Magic%20Rules/Casting%20Type/">Casting Type</a>. (See Casting Type on the Magic page)

## Caster’s Concentration

As a spellcaster, a sorcerer gains ranks in the Concentration skill equal to his class level.

## Spell Pool

A sorcerer gains access to a magical source of energy known as a spell pool. This pool contains a number of spell points equal to his levels in casting classes + his casting ability modifier (minimum 1). This pool replenishes once per day after a long rest.

## Implements

A sorcerer may use any piece of jewelry as an implement. In addition the Sorcerer’s bloodline may add additional options for his implements.

## Magic Talents

A sorcerer gains a magic talent according to their talents column (gaining ¾ of a talent each level rounded down), each magic talent may be used to learn a new talent or new spell the sorcerer qualifies for. In addition she gains a bonus spell (but not talent) every 5 Class levels he possesses.

## Bloodline (Su)

At 1st level, a sorcerer unlocks the power of his bloodline, a representation of innate magic gained through ritual or familial lineage that the sorcerer has learned to tap into. The sorcerer selects a single bloodline, the bloodline determines much about the sorcerer’s capabilities and progression going as far as changing his BCB, BAB, and even Hit dice. These are each listed on the selected bloodline, and apply immediately to the sorcerer upon acquisition. If a bloodline power calls for a save attack it is made at 1d20 + ½ SPB + CAM; the sorcerer may add any enhancement bonuses from his implement to this save attack.

For a complete listing of sorcerer bloodlines, see [[./Sorcerer Bloodlines/index|Sorcerer Bloodlines]]

## Innate Power (Su)

At 1st level, a sorcerer gains the Innate Power ability of his bloodline.

## Bloodline Trait (Su)
At 1st level, a sorcerer gains his bloodline’s bloodline trait. A bloodline trait is a manifestation of the sorcerer’s bloodline granting others insight into his nature usually in the form of physical traits that can range from eye color to more drastic changes such as growing claws or a tail. Unless disguised a creature may easily spot these with a DC 12 perception check, and may make a DC 30 knowledge arcane check to identify the sorcerer’s bloodline; as he gains additional traits this knowledge check DC is reduced as the sorcerer’s bloodline becomes more prominent and manifest.

## Bloodline Boon (Su)

At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the sorcerer may select a bloodline boon. These boons are selected from either from the table of general sorcerer bloodline boons, or boons granted by their specific bloodline. If a bloodline boon calls for a save attack it is made at 1d20 + ½ SPB + Charisma modifier; the sorcerer may add any enhancement bonuses from his implement to this save attack.

For a complete listing of general bloodline boons, see [[./List of General Sorcerer Bloodline Boons|List of General Sorcerer Bloodline Boons]]

## Improved Bloodline Trait (Su)

At 3rd level, the sorcerer gains his bloodline’s improved bloodline trait. In addition this additional trait reduces the knowledge DC to identify the sorcerer’s bloodline by an additional 5. In addition the sorcerer’s traits become so prominent they are visible even when a magical effect would change his appearance such as polymorph spells; requiring additional mundane effects such as a disguise kit to help hide these elements.

## Emerging Power (Su)

At 5th level, a sorcerer gains the Emerging Power ability of his bloodline.

## Bloodline Senses (Su)

At 7th level, a sorcerer gains the bloodline senses of his bloodline. In addition the sorcerer becomes familiar with his own kind, gaining a +10 bonus knowledge checks made to identify the bloodline of another sorcerer who shares the same bloodline as himself.

## Bloodline Suppression (Su)

At 7th level, the sorcerer learns to temporarily suppress the power of his bloodline and suppress any visual traits of his bloodline. As a 4 AP action the sorcerer suppresses all abilities of his bloodline, losing access to any traits or powers of his bloodline. While in this state the sorcerer maintains any granted spells, BAB, and HIt dice adjustments of his bloodline, but has the BCB of a sorcerer without his bloodline and loses any other bloodline specific BCB adjustments. During this state creatures cannot spot or identify his bloodline aspects nor can they attempt to identify his bloodline. Ending this effect is a full-round action; the sorcerer may reduce this to a move action but is then staggered on his next turn.

## Greater Bloodline Trait (Su)

At 9th level, the sorcerer gains his bloodline’s greater bloodline trait. In addition this additional trait reduces the knowledge DC to identify the sorcerer’s bloodline by an additional 5.

## Bloodline Intensity (Su)

At 10th level, the force of a sorcerer’s spells become that of legend. The sorcerer treats any resist against his bloodline’s affinity as 1 lower for every 5 strength or pysche modifier he possesses (minimum 1), whichever is higher.

## Actualized Power (Su)

At 11th level, a sorcerer gains the Actualized Power of his bloodline.

## Spell Devouring (Su)

At 13th level, the sorcerer learns to use his innate connection to break the structure of magic around him and absorb it into himself. When a creature within 60 feet of the sorcerer attempts to cast a spell, he may expend a spell point as a reaction to attempt to absorb the magic. The sorcerer makes a dispel attempt (1d20 + your SPB) against the caster (1d20 + the caster’s SPB). If their check is higher the effect is dispelled and the spell fails. If the sorcerer succeeds he gains a number of temporary hit points equal to twice the BCB of the spell for 1 hour.

## Bloodline Aspect (Su)

At 15th level, a sorcerer gains the Bloodline Aspect ability of his bloodline.

## One With Magic (Su)

At 17th level, even the most hostile of magic seems to empower the sorcerer, leaving a piece of itself behind. Whenever the sorcerer succeeds as a saving throw, or prevents a spell through spell resistance, or reduces the damage of an elemental spell to 0 through resistance or immunity; the sorcerer gains temporary hit points equal to his sorcerer level for a number of rounds equal to his casting ability modifier. In addition while the sorcerer retains these temporary hit points he gains a +2 morale bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and save attack rolls.

## Bloodline Paragon (Su)

At 19th level, the sorcerer learns to become more than the sum of his parts, becoming a paragon of both himself and his bloodline. The sorcerer gains the Bloodline paragon ability of his bloodline. In addition this reduces the knowledge DC to identify the sorcerer’s bloodline by an additional 5.

### Bloodline Manifestation (Su)

At 20th level, the sorcerer gains the Bloodline Manifestation ability of his bloodline.

# Sorcerer Exclusive Magic Talents
