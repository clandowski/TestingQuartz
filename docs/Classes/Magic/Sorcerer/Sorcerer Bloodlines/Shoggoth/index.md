Through strange rituals, or stranger circumstances you draw lineage of the aberrations of the deep known as shoggoth.

## Ability Adjustments
The Angelic Bloodline adjusts the following sorcerer progressions:
 - **Hit Dice:** d10
 - **Base Attack Bonus:** Low (.5)
 - **Base Caster Bonus:** High (1)

## Bloodline Implement
The sorcerer may use shells or objects crafted from the bones of a sea creature as an implement.

## Innate Power - Creature of Entropy
The sorcerer gains Void (Air Anima) affinity as a bonus talent. If this is not your first level in a casting class you do not gain the associated affinity talent. In addition the sorcerer may use Void (Air Anima) affinity to qualify for and cast spells with Water (Essence) affinity as prerequisite, but doing so causes spells cast in this way to be treated as Void (Air Anima) affinity spells. The sorcerer gains the Wave Shield spell as a bonus spell.

## Bloodline Trait - Body of the Deep
Your body is already attuned to the deep, granting you the ability to breathe underwater indefinitely. If you already possess the ability to breathe underwater you instead may treat your constitution score as double for determining how long you may hold your breath in any environment.

## Improved Bloodline Trait - Improved Body of the Deep
The sorcerer’s body begins to slightly degrade in appearance, taking on a vaguely slimy appearance and making you seem slightly less solid. In addition from this slime you gain two tentacle natural weapons (1d4 medium, 1d3 small). In addition you gain a swim speed equal to your land speed. At 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter these tentacles gain an additional 5 feet of reach for the purposes of delivering melee touch spells.

## Emerging Power - Touch of Entropy
The sorcerer’s ability to cleanse instead corrupts. When casting a healing keyword spell that restores hit points he may choose to instead corrupt it causing it to instead deal void damage and allowing the application of disruption type talents from the disrupting touch spell to these spells. In addition when casting a healing keyword spell that cures status ailments the sorcerer may cause the spell to make a fortitude save attack against the creature, if he succeeds the duration of all tiered status ailments the spell can affect are increased by 1d4 rounds. Spells modified by this ability are no longer treated as having the healing keyword, but instead gain the curse keyword.

The sorcerer gains cure as a bonus spell, and may cast it as if it was a water-affinity talent for the purposes of determining if he can cast it with his Innate Power  (Creature of Entropy).

## Bloodline Senses - Deep Sense
The sorcerer attains greater senses of the deep, in addition becoming attuned to the suffering of creatures. You gain Darkvision 60. If you already possessed Darkvision your Darkvision improves by 30 feet. At 10th level you gain tremorsense of 30 feet. These senses improve by an additional 30 feet at 15th level.

## Greater Bloodline Trait - Greater Body of the Deep
The sorcerer’s body becomes more like a shoggoth sprouting various dark eyes with white pupils all across his body granting him the all-around vision universal ability. In addition his body becomes chaotic and difficult to understand granting a 5% chance per sorcerer level to negate a critical hit or precision damage.

## Actualized Power - Engulf
The sorcerer gains the engulf universal ability; with a Physical(Agi) save attack of 1d20 + ½ SPB + Endurance modifier; and dealing 1d6 void damage per 5 sorcerer levels as long as the target remains engulfed. For the purposes of maintaining grapples initiated through his engulf ability the sorcerer treats his BAB from his sorcerer levels as equal to his class level.

## Bloodline Aspect - Gibbering Maws
The sorcerer may spend 1 spell point as a 2 AP action to create sounds and words that tear at the sanity of creatures near them. The sorcerer makes a will save attack against all creatures within 60 feet that can hear the sorcerer. A successful Resilience(Psy) save attack causes creatures affected to become confused for 1d6 rounds, +1 round for each degree of success. In addition for each round they suffer from this confusion effect the creature takes 1d4 points of Focus damage. The sorcerer may not attempt to use this ability again on a single creature more than once per 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect.

## Bloodline Paragon - Entropic Attunement
The sorcerer embraces being partly a chaotic creature allowing the sorcerer to be instead be healed by void damage; though the sorcerer can't heal himself using these elements against himself. In addition the sorcerer adds his class level to all void damage he deals including damage from his engulf ability; and deals void damage as part of attacks (including touch attacks) made with his tentacles.

## Bloodline Manifestation - True Shoggoth
The sorcerer gains immunity to blindness, deafness, and DR 20/Slashing or Piercing. In addition the sorcerer gains regeneration 5 that is suppressed for 1 round if the sorcerer takes damage from an Air affinity spell or effect.
