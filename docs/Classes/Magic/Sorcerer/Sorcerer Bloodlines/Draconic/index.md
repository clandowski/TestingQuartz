title: Draconic

Your blood has the power of dragons flowing within it, granting you both the might and innate magic of dragons.

## Ability Adjustments
The Angelic Bloodline adjusts the following sorcerer progressions:
 - **Hit Dice:** d10
 - **Base Attack Bonus:** Mid (.75)
 - **Base Caster Bonus:** Mid (0.75)

## Bloodline Implement
The sorcerer may treat any enhancement bonus to his claws as an implement enhancement bonus. In addition he may treat claw blades as implements.

## Innate Power - Draconic Lineage
You select a single draconic lineage granting you an affinity talent and a single shape talent; the sorcerer treats his BCB as equal to his class level for the purposes of spells matching his draconic lineage’s affinity. If this is not your first level in a casting class you do not gain the associated affinity talent. The sorcerer gains the elemental blast spell as a bonus spell.

|Draconic Lineage|Affinity|Shape Talent|
|---|---|---|
|Adamantine|Air (Essence)|Explosion|
|Blue|Water (Essence)|Beam|
|Bronze|Earth (Water Anima)|Explosion|
|Gold|Fire (Essence)|Beam|
|Green|Nature (Essence)|Beam|
|Platinum|Air (Essence)|Cone|
|Red|Fire (Essence)|Cone|
|Silver|Cold (Fire Anima)|Beam|
|Umbral|Void (Air Anima)|Explosion|
|White|Cold (Fire Anima)|Cone|

## Bloodline Trait - Draconic Body
The sorcerer’s pupils become more reptilian in look. In addition the sorcerer gains two claw attacks (1d4 for medium creatures, 1d3 if small). If the sorcerer already possessed a pair of claw attacks their damage dice is improved by 1 step.

## Improved Bloodline Trait - Improved Draconic Body
The sorcerer’s skin begins to grow scales in various locations across his body; granting him a +1 natural armor bonus, or increasing his existing natural armor by additional 1. For every 3 levels after 3rd this bonus improves by an additional 1.

## Emerging Power - Draconic Breath
You learn to access your draconic lineage’s breath weapon. This breath weapon deals 1d8 points of damage of your elemental type per 2 BCB; though the sorcerer may choose to spend a spell point to improve the damage of this ability to 1d8 per BCB.  Make a Physical(Agi) save attack against all creatures within the area; a failed save attack deals half damage. The shape of the breath weapon may have shape talents applied to it as if it was a spell with the shaped keyword, but does not incur the associated spell point cost if using the shape talent granted by his draconic lineage.

The sorcerer may use this ability twice per day plus an additional time per day for every 4 levels of sorcerer after 5th the sorcerer possesses; the sorcerer must wait 1d4 rounds between uses.

The sorcerer otherwise treats this ability as a natural spell of his chosen affinity for the purposes of determining his BCB of the shape talent and the save attack of this ability; but is otherwise treated as an extraordinary ability.

## Bloodline Senses - Draconic Senses
Your senses become more like that of a Dragon gaining Darkvision 60 feet and blindsense of 10. If you already possessed Darkvision your darkvision improves by 30 feet. For every 3 levels after 7th the range of your blindsense improves by 10 feet.

## Greater Bloodline Trait - Greater Draconic Body
The sorcerer gains a bite natural attack (1d6 medium, 1d4 small) that deals 1.5x strength modifier damage on hit rather than the normal 1x. In addition, the sorcerer gains a pair of leathery dragon wings that he may grow as a 3 AP action. These wings grant the sorcerer a fly speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability. The sorcerer may dismiss the wings as a free action. At 12th level this speed improves to 90 feet.

## Actualized Power - Draconic Might
The physical prowess of dragons begins to infuse you with power allowing the sorcerer to temporarily call upon this power. The sorcerer may spend a spell point as a reaction and grant himself a +2 class bonus to a single physical ability score of his choice for a number of rounds equal to his charisma modifier. This improves by an additional +2 for every 2 levels after 11th to a maximum of +6 for a single ability score. The sorcerer may split this bonus up between ability scores in increments of +2 (for example when he has +6 he may have +4 in strength and +2 in dexterity). At 18th level the sorcerer may choose a single ability score, he gains a permanent +6 racial bonus to that chosen ability score.

## Bloodline Aspect - Draconic Transformation
You learn to take on the aspect of dragons, gaining transformation as a bonus spell with draconic transformation from talent, and once per day plus an additional time per day per 2 levels after 15th the sorcerer may reduce the cost of this spell by 2 (minimum 0) as long as he’s using the draconic transformation form. If you already possess these talents or later gain them, when transformed into the draconic form you may apply the size change alter talent to this form as a bonus trait without counting against your trait limit for transformation. In addition when using the breath weapon of the draconic form you may expend one use of your draconic bloodline’s breath weapon to instead deal damage as if you had used your breath weapon but treating it as if you had applied the empowered meta talent to it; using this ability adds an additional 2 rounds before you may use your breath weapon again.

## Bloodline Paragon - Draconic Channeling
For a limited time the sorcerer draws upon the powers of the dragon empowering a number of his abilities gaining the following benefits:

- The sorcerer’s claws damage is improved by one size category and deals 1d6 elemental damage of a type matching his draconic lineage’s affinity.
- The sorcerer gains DR 10/Magic and Adamantine.
- The sorcerer’s breath weapon improves to 2d4 instead of 1d8 per sorcerer level, and gains the benefits of the widen spell meta talent without the increased spell point cost as long as he uses it with the associated shape talent of his draconic lineage.
- The sorcerer gains a tail slap natural weapon dealing 1d6 damage (1d4 if small); if the sorcerer already possessed one the damage of their tail slap improves by 1 step.
- The sorcerer’s fly speed from his greater bloodline trait improves by an additional 30 feet, and grants him two wing natural weapons each dealing 1d4 damage (1d3 if small); if the sorcerer already possessed one the damage of their wing natural weapons improves by 1 step.
- The sorcerer gains the frightful presence(60 feet) universal ability and may treat his hit dice as 2 higher for the purposes of determining what creatures it may affect.

The sorcerer may activate this ability as a 3 AP action, and lasts for 1 minute and may only be used once per day plus an additional time per day at 20th level. This effect is treated as a polymorph effect similar to alter self, not altering the creature’s base form, but not stacking with other polymorph abilities the sorcerer may possess or be affected by.

## Bloodline Manifestation - True Draconic Body
The sorcerer’s draconic blood becomes fully manifest. The sorcerer gains immunity to paralysis and sleep. In addition the sorcerer's scales become much more resistant to magic granting them 40% spell resistance; if the sorcerer had another source of non-temporary spell resistance he instead improves his existing spell resistance by 15%.
