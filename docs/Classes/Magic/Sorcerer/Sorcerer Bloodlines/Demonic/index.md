Similar to that of tieflings your heritage involves that of a demonic elemental, but you’ve learned to draw out more power than most from this.

## Ability Adjustments
The Angelic Bloodline adjusts the following sorcerer progressions:
 - **Hit Dice:** d12
 - **Base Attack Bonus:** Full (1)
 - **Base Caster Bonus:** Low (0.5)

## Bloodline Implement
The sorcerer may use a light or heavy mace, flail, or whip as his implement.

## Innate Power - Demonic Nature
If this is your first level in a casting class you gain void (Air Anima) or Fire (Essence) affinity as a bonus affinity talent. In addition the sorcerer gains power stance as a bonus feat.

## Bloodline Trait - Demonic Body
The sorcerer’s skin begins to take on more fiendish tone as their body begins to manifest the traits of their demonic heritage. The sorcerer gains resist 1 against Void and Fire. If the sorcerer already possesses any of these resistances from their race they instead improve by 1. At 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter these resistances improve by an additional 1.

## Improved Bloodline Trait - Improved Demonic Body
Your body becomes infused with demonic might, causing the sorcerer’s physical appearance to become gradually bulkier. The sorcerer gains a +1 class bonus to his choice of Strength or Constitution. For every 3 levels after 3rd this bonus improves by an additional 1 to a maximum of +6. In addition the sorcerer sprouts a pair of horns granting him a gore attack (1d6 medium, 1d4 small).

## Emerging Power - Hellfire
The sorcerer learns to summon a pillar of hellfire in a 10 foot radius burst within 60 feet of the sorcerer. The pillar must originate on the ground but rises into the air 10 feet per sorcerer level. For every 5 levels of sorcerer the radius and range of this ability improves by an additional 5 feet. Creatures within the pillar are subject to a Physical(Agi) save attack, with a successful save attack dealing 1d4 fire and 1d4 void damage per 2 SPB the sorcerer possesses. The sorcerer may spend a spell point to improve this damage to 2d4 fire and 2d4 void damage per 2 SPB the sorcerer possesses. The sorcerer may use this once per day, plus an additional time per day per 4 sorcerer levels he possesses (minimum 1).

## Bloodline Senses - Demonic Senses
You attain the senses of an elemental, in addition becoming attuned to the suffering of creatures. You gain Darkvision 60, as well as blindsense 60 but only for locating creatures who are bleeding or below half the maximum hit points within this area of darkvision. If you already possessed Darkvision your Darkvision improves by 30 feet. For every 3 levels after 7th the range of these senses improves by an additional 10 feet.

## Greater Bloodline Trait - Greater Demonic Body
You sprout a pair of demonic wings and a tail. These wings grant the sorcerer a fly speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability. At 12th level this speed improves to 90 feet. The tail grants the sorcerer the teifling’s prehensile tail, and coordinated tail feats; if the sorcerer already had a tail or either of these feats he becomes capable of wielding two-handed weapons using his tail, but takes a -2 penalty unless he possesses the giant’s grip feat.

## Actualized Power - Demonic Aura
The sorcerer learns to emit an aura of demonic power. The sorcerer may activate and deactivate this ability as a reaction on his turn by spending a spell point. Creatures who end their turns within the sorcerer’s natural reach take 2d4 + his Psyche modifier void damage, and 2d4 + his Endurance modifier fire damage. This aura lasts a number of rounds equal to his psyche modifier.

## Bloodline Aspect - Demonic Transformation
The sorcerer learns to grow in size to that of a great demon. Allowing the sorcerer to increase his size by one category for every 5 sorcerer levels he possesses. Any weapons or equipment the sorcerer possesses are automatically resized to them for the duration of this effect. This is not a polymorph effect but cannot be combined with other effects that would increase the sorcerer’s size. The sorcerer may activate this ability by spending a spell point as a reaction; granting him this increased size for 1 minute per 3 sorcerer levels.

Note: See the “Creature Size Chart” in the combat rules for a list of all the adjustments a creature gains for a change in size.

## Bloodline Paragon - Devour Soul
The sorcerer taps into the depths of his demonic lineage and learns to manipulate and empower himself using the souls of others. When the sorcerer makes an Execute attempt he gains the additional effects. If he successfully slays the creature he draws out the soul of the creature and devours it. The sorcerer gains a number of temporary hit points equal to twice the hit dice of the slain creature for 1 minute. These temporary hit points count as if the sorcerer had successfully used his one with magic ability granting him the morale bonuses from the ability as long as he retains these temporary hit points. When these temporary hit points are depleted through damage, any number of creatures of the sorcerer’s choosing within 30 feet of the sorcerer is subject to a Resilience(Psy) save attack, with a successful save attack causing creatures to gain the shaken condition for 1d4+1 rounds, becoming a higher tier of fear effect for each additional degree of success. If this save attack fails by less than one degree the creatures are still shaken for 1 round.

## Bloodline Manifestation - True Demon
The sorcerer becomes one with his demonic heritage improving his resistances to fire and void damage to immunity, and instead allowing the sorcerer to be healed for half the damage dealt by these elements; though the sorcerer cannot heal himself using elemental effects originating from himself.

In addition, once per round the sorcerer may spend a spell point as a focused attack, making a Resilience(End) save attack against the creature on a successful hit. A successful save attack causes the creature to take 1d4+1 Endurance and Focus drain in addition to the damage of the attack; and the sorcerer gains temporary hit points equal to the ability drain done. These temporary hit points count as if the sorcerer had successfully used his one with magic ability granting him the morale bonuses from the ability as long as he retains these temporary hit points. If the creature is slain by this attack the creature is treated as having been slain by his demon bloodline paragon ability, gaining all the benefits in addition to the benefits of this ability.

| Bonus Feat (Ex)      | \-                         | The sorcerer may select a single combat or martial feat that he qualifies for as a bonus feat. The sorcerer may select this bloodline boon multiple times each time selecting a new feat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Hellfire Strike (Su) | Sorcerer 6th               | Once per round while in power stance you may spend a spell point and a use of your hellfire ability as a reaction when you miss a creature with a melee attack to continue the swing and strike the ground causing your hellfire to erupt from underneath them. This area of hellfire must be adjacent to you. Using this ability puts the sorcerer off balance making them staggered during their next turn.                                                                                                                                                             |
| Shatter Soul (Su)    | Sorcerer 20th              | When using his bloodline paragon ability the sorcerer damages the creature's soul to the point it becomes nearly impossible to restore them. Creatures attempting to raise a creature whom the sorcerer had devoured their soul via their bloodline paragon ability must make a SPB check against the sorcerer at a -5 penalty. If they succeed the creature is restored to life as normal, If they fail the creature’s body is returned to life, but as soulless husk.                                                                                                   |
| Spirit Bleed (Su)    | \-                         | You learn to sap a creature’s strength without killing them to prolong their suffering. Once per round as  part of a melee attack the Sorcerer may designate the melee attack to cause Spirit Bleed. The attack itself deals no damage but the creature begins to take a special type of bleed effect equal to the weapon’s damage dice. This functions as normal bleed except the creature takes nonlethal damage each time the bleed would deal damage. When the creature would begin taking lethal damage from this nonlethal damage the bleed effect immediately ends |
| Spirit Rip (Su)      | Spirit Bleed, Sorcerer 6th | When the bleed from the sorcerer’s spirit bleed is removed either through healing or through the effect ending due to the target taking the limit of their nonlethal damage the creature is subject to a Resilience(End) Save Attack. If you succeed the creature takes 1d4 points of ability damage to its Endurance and Psyche; for every additional degree of success the ability damage from this ability improves by 1. The sorcerer gains a number of temporary hit points equal to ability damage dealt with this ability that lasts 1 minute before disappearing. |
