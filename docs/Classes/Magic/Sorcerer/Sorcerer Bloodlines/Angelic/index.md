Your lineage is that of angels. Similar to Nephilim your heritage is that of heavenly beings; but you have learned to draw additional power from this.

## Ability Adjustments
The Angelic Bloodline adjusts the following sorcerer progressions:
 - **Hit Dice:** d8
 - **Base Attack Bonus:** Mid (.75)
 - **Base Caster Bonus:** High (1)

## Bloodline Implement
The sorcerer may use a holy symbol, religious text, or sacred relic as their implement.

## Innate Power (Healing Light)
The sorcerer gains Air(Essence) affinity as a bonus talent. If this is not your first level in a casting class you do not gain the associated affinity talent. The sorcerer gains the cure spell as a bonus spell; and the sorcerer may use air affinity to qualify and cast spells with the healing keyword, despite their usual requirements; this includes any talents with the spell as a prerequisite.

## Bloodline Trait - Angelic Body
The sorcerer’s skin begins to take on a more fair complexion as well as gaining the barest hint of a metallic sheen. The sorcerer gains Resist 1 against void and fire. If the sorcerer already possesses any of these resistances from their race they instead improve by 1. At 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter these resistances improve by an additional 1.

## Improved Bloodline Trait - Improved Angelic Body
The sorcerer’s skin begins to harden against outside harm.  The sorcerer gains DR 1/- improving by 1 for every 2 levels of sorcerer he possesses.

## Emerging Power - Angelic Blessing
You gain the ability to bless your allies adjusting their fates to become more favorable. As a 3 AP action may select one ally within 30 feet granting them a +1 luck bonus to a number of d20 rolls equal to your CAM, for up to 1 minute. The creature cannot choose which d20 roll these apply to. For every 6 levels of sorcerer you possess you can select an additional creature per use of this ability. At 10th level and every 10 levels thereafter this bonus improves by an additional 1.

## Bloodline Senses - Angelic Senses
You attain the senses of an Angel, in addition becoming attuned to the suffering of creatures. You gain lifesense 30 feet; any creature you can detect with lifesight you can also determine if they are above or below half their hit points. At 10th level this lifesense improves to 60 feet.

## Greater Bloodline Trait - Greater Angelic Body
You sprout a pair of feathery angelic wings and a halo. These wings grant the sorcerer a fly speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability. If the sorcerer already has a pair of wings this fly speed improves by 30 feet and the maneuverability improves to good. The sorcerer gains a halo, increasing the light level around them by 2 steps to a maximum of bright within an area of 30 feet. If the sorcerer already has the halo from the Nephilim race feat he instead increases the light level by 3 steps.

## Actualized Power - Heaven's Guidance
You begin to find your power helping guide your actions. A number of times per day equal to your CAM, you can reroll any one ability check, attack roll, skill check, or saving throw you just made as a reaction. You must decide to use this ability after the die is rolled, but before the results are revealed. You must take the second result, even if it is worse.

## Bloodline Aspect - Divine Transformation
The sorcerer briefly takes on the appearance of the divine, causing creatures to recoil from its glory. The sorcerer may spend a spell point as a 2 AP action to make a Metal(Foc) and Physical(Agi) save attack against hostile creatures within 60 feet of the sorcerer. The sorcerer uses the same roll for both save attacks. A successful Physical(Agi) save attack causes creatures within the area to become blinded for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful Metal(Foc) save attack causes the creatures to become shaken for 1d4+1 rounds. Creatures who make either save against this ability become immune to additional uses of the ability for 24 hours. Creatures without sight are immune to this ability.

## Bloodline Paragon - Holy Aura
You learn to emit a holy aura, empowering your allies. For a number of rounds per day per sorcerer level you may cause all allies within 60 feet to gain a +2 deific bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, AC rolls, save attack rolls, and saving throws. Creatures who already possess a deific bonus to one of these rolls instead improve their existing bonus by 1. In addition when you first activate this aura, and the start of your turn each round thereafter, allies within the aura gain temporary hit points equal to your psyche modifier, that last until the start of your next turn. Activating this ability is a reaction and may be ended as a free action.

## Bloodline Manifestation - True Angelic Body
The sorcerer gains immunity to poison, petrification, and nonlethal damage. In addition the sorcerer may use the reroll ability of their actualized power a number of additional times per day equal to half their sorcerer level.
