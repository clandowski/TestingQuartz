You have the power of the immortal phoenix, granting health and longevity to yourself and those around you.

## Ability Adjustments
The Angelic Bloodline adjusts the following sorcerer progressions:
 - **Hit Dice:** d10
 - **Base Attack Bonus:** Mid (.75)
 - **Base Caster Bonus:** Mid (.75)

## Bloodline Implement
The sorcerer gains no additional implements.

## Innate Power - Fiery Restoration
The sorcerer gains Fire (Essence) affinity as a bonus affinity; the sorcerer treats his BCB as equal to his class level for the purposes of spells with fire affinity. If this is not your first level in a casting class you do not gain the associated affinity talent. The sorcerer gains the wield element spell as a bonus spell.

## Bloodline Trait - Phoenix Body
The sorcerer’s body becomes attuned to the fire of his phoenix bloodline, giving off a somewhat soothing warmth, and making him more resistant to fire. The sorcerer gains Resist 2 fire; If the sorcerer already possesses this resistance from their race they instead improve this to Resist 3. At 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter these resistances improve by an additional 1.

## Improved Bloodline Trait - Phoenix Plumes
The sorcerer’s arms begin to grow small plumes of feathers on their arms of fiery red tipped with blue giving it the look of flames. The sorcerer may expend a feather as a reaction as part of casting a spell to allow the sorcerer to add their sorcerer level to any fire damage or healing to the affected spell. The sorcerer may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his endurance modifier (minimum 3). In addition while the sorcerer has uses per day left of this ability the sorcerer is treated as having a glide speed of 10 feet.

## Emerging Power - Phoenix Warmth
The sorcerer learns to extend his warmth as a phoenix granting bonuses to his allies, while harming his foes. As a 2 AP action the sorcerer can emit a 30 foot aura, granting all allies within the area half his fire resistance (minimum 1) as well as an equal amount of cold resistance. In addition each hostile creature that begins their turn within this area takes fire damage equal to the sorcerer’s charisma modifier. This aura lasts for 1 minute. The sorcerer may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 2 + his Psyche modifier.

## Bloodline Senses - Life Sight
The sorcerer’s senses as a phoenix make him attuned to the flow of life around him; gaining Lifesight 10 feet. This area improves by 5 feet at 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter.

## Greater Bloodline Trait - Improved Phoenix Plumes
The feathers upon the sorcerer’s arms become more vibrant and plentiful. This grants the sorcerer additional uses per day of his phoenix bloodline improved bloodline trait equal to half his sorcerer level; and in addition he no longer loses his glide speed when he has no more uses per day of that ability.

The sorcerer also gains the ability to transform his arms into a pair of wings as a 3 AP action gaining a fly speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability, improving to 90 feet at 12th level. While in this form the sorcerer no longer has hands, but any implement he was holding when the transformation occurred is merged into this new form and is considered held for the purpose of casting spells. In addition the sorcerer gains two wing attacks appropriate to his size while using this ability that deal an additional 1d4+Psyche modifier fire damage on hit in addition to the normal damage dealt by the wing attack..

## Actualized Power - Phoenix Resurgence
The phoenix is known as the harbinger of rebirth and your power begins to display this. The sorcerer may expend two uses of his phoenix plumes improved bloodline trait as a 3 AP action to touch a creature and grant them the effects as if he had used the Life-Saving Cure talent but it automatically returns the creature to 1 hit point rather than requiring healing. This ability must still be used on a creature that died from hit point damage within 1 round, and grants the temporary negative level as unusual.

## Bloodline Aspect - Soothing Warmth
When using the phoenix warmth emerging power he may spend an additional use of the ability to improve the area to 60 feet. When improving this area the sorcerer may also choose to spend a spell point to further empower this aura. When empowering this aura the ability immediately grants a number of hit points to all allies within the area equal to the sorcerer’s charisma modifier, and grants all allies within the area fast healing 5 while they remain within the area. Hostile creatures within the area take an additional 1d6 fire damage in addition to the normal fire damage caused by this ability.

The sorcerer also gains an additional 1 use per 5 sorcerer level he possesses to his phoenix bloodline emerging power.

## Bloodline Paragon - Phoenix Rebirth
The sorcerer gains immunity to all fire damage, though does not grant this bonus to others when using his emerging power bloodline ability.

In addition the sorcerer gains regeneration 5 rather than fast healing while using his empowered aura from his phoenix bloodline aspect.

If the sorcerer is returned above his death threshold from this regeneration before the aura would expire he may choose to return to life in a fiery explosion. When using this ability he may choose to immediately end his empowered aura and set himself to 1 hit point. All hostile creatures within his Bloodline Aspect’s empowered aura are subject to a reflex save attack. A successful save attack deals 1d8 fire damage per sorcerer SPB he possess plus an additional amount of damage equal to the amount of health he gained when using this ability (from his death threshold to 1 hit point); while a failed save attack deals half. The sorcerer may use this ability once per day plus an additional time at 20th.

## Bloodline Manifestation - Eternal Phoenix
The sorcerer becomes one with his phoenix bloodline; gaining fast healing 5 for 1 round anytime he is hit by fire damage (even if the damage was negated due to the fire immunity.).

In addition the sorcerer may use his bloodline paragon ability to return to life even if he did not activate his phoenix bloodline aspect’s empowered aura, he is automatically restored to 1 hit point as if he had ended his empowered aura. Using this ability in this way uses all uses per day of the ability. In addition the sorcerer is always returned to the prime of youth (usually the start of adulthood) when using this ability, and may even use this ability in response to dying of old age, allowing him to reverse the effects of aging.
