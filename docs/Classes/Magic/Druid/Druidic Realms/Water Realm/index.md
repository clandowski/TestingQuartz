## Root Power
The Druid’s ironwood equipment is imbued with the element of water.

The druid’s ironwood weapons deal an additional 1d4 water damage and gain the concussive property; if the weapon already has the concussive property the druid may treat her BAB as equal to her levels in druid for the purposes of determining the damage of the concussive ability of this weapon. In addition the druid may choose to allow her weapons to float or sink in water when they are created.

The druid’s ironwood armor grants the druid a +2 bonus to Athletics checks to swim when worn. In addition, the druid may spend a spell point as an reaction when struck by a melee attack to cause a 5 foot radius burst around them; creatures within the area are subject to a bull rush reposition maneuver using the druid’s class level in place of their BAB for the purposes of determining her MSB for this manuever, the druid may not move with the target as part of this ability; the druid must wait at least 2 rounds between uses of this ability for ironwood to restore enough water.
## Nature Stride
The druid’s motion is not hindered in water and may attack without penalty; and the druid may cast spells underwater without issue. In addition the druid takes no penalty to movement speed when walking through shallow water (water not quite deep enough to swim in, but deep enough to hinder movement), such as from bogs, shorelines, streams, and even partially flooded areas.
## Deeper Roots
The druid gains the air geyser spell and the wave geyser talent as a bonus spell and talent even if she would not meet the prerequisites. The druid may not cast air geyser without wave geyser applied unless the later gains the prerequisites to cast the spell normally.

If the druid already has the air geyser spell she may instead gain a different air geyser talent she qualifies for.
## Deeper Bond
The druid reduces the AP cost of any spell that restores hit points or grants temporary hit points to a single creature with a casting time of a 4 AP action or less by 1 AP (minimum 1). When targeting herself the druid may instead reduces the AP cost by 2 (minimum 1).
## Greater Realm
The druid heightens their healing capabilities, cleansing any illnesses. As a 4 AP action a druid may cause a body of water they are in to heal all tier 2 or lower ailments of creatures who come in contact with the water, and grants them regeneration 1 while the remain in contact with the water. This area lasts for 1 minute. This ability can affect an area of water of up to a 30 foot radius from the druid. If the body of water is larger than this radius the effect is dissipated after 1d6+1 rounds, reduced by 1 round per 5 feet larger the area is than this radius (minimum 1 round). As part of casting this ability the druid may select a number of creatures up to their CAM modifier to exclude from this effect. The druid may use this once per day per 6 druid levels she possesses, and may spend two spell points as a 4 AP  to regain a single use of this ability.
