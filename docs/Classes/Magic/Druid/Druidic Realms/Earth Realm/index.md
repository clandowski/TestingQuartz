## Root Power
The druid may create her ironwood equipment out of stone. Ironwood armor made of stone grants the druid a +1 bonus to Physical saves against combat maneuvers, while stone weapons grant her a +1 bonus to MSB for combat maneuvers made with these weapons.  These bonuses increase by an additional 1 at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.

The hardness and hit points of any ironwood equipment made of stone is increased by 50%, but weighs twice as much as well. Any weapon made of stone has its damage converted to bludgeoning if it normally deals Piercing or Slashing damage, and armor has its strength rating increased by 1.

While wearing armor made of stone the druid gains DR 1/- and improves by an additional 1 for every 5 levels of druid she possesses. Stone weapons wielded by the druid, including either through boulder toss druid magic talent or this root power of the earth realm, bypass 1 DR or hardness plus an additional 1 for every 5 levels of druid she possesses. If within an area of stone or loose rubble her stone weapons and armor heal any damage they have taken at the rate of 1 hit point per minute while she remains within these areas.

In addition you may summon your ironwood out of stone objects of at least medium size if this root power would be applied to them.
## Nature Stride
The druid may move through rubble, rocks, or other stone-based difficult terrain at her normal speed as long as the terrain is not caused by ongoing magic, or the magic is from the druid herself.
## Deeper Roots
The druid gains wield element and boulder toss as a bonus spell and talent even if she does not meet the prerequisites. When using the boulder toss talent the druid may add her 2x her Strength modifier (minimum 1) in addition to her casting ability modifier to the damage of the thrown boulders. In addition the druid may choose to use her Strength modifier instead of her Agility modifier for the ranged attack rolls made by this ability. If the druid has the hulking hurler minor perk she gains a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with this ability if she chooses to throw these weapons using Strength.
## Deeper Bond
The druid gains tremorsense of 60 feet, the earth glide special quality, and a burrow speed equal to his base speed. In addition the druid ignores any miss chance against foes she can see with her tremorsense when using the wield element spell with earth affinity. At 15th level the druid may use her earth glide ability on iron or metals with an equal or lower hardness.
## Greater Realm
A number of times per day equal to the druid’s casting ability modifier she may use her create wall spell as a reaction by spending an additional spell point. This ability can only be used as a reaction once per round. She must have the wall of earth talent applied to use this ability. When used in this way the wall can only have a maximum length of 40 feet and may only exist in squares adjacent to the druid. This ability may protect the druid from an incoming attack or spell if the wall would break line of effect. The wall disappears at the start of the druid’s next turn.
