## Root Power
The druid’s ironwood is further strengthened by the druid’s bond to plant life. Any weapons made of the druid’s ironwood deal damage if they were a size category larger while wielded by the druid. Ironwood armor worn by the druid may treat its armor bonus as 2 higher for the purposes of determining its hit points and the amount of damage that may be redirected to it. In addition the druid’s ironwood slowly mends itself regaining 1 hit point every hour it remains in the druid’s possession. Finally the druid’s mastery over plantlife allows her to reshape her ironwood as a 2 AP action; if the druid gains improved ironwood she may instead reduce this to a reaction that may only be used on the druid's turn.
## Nature Stride
The druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment as long as the undergrowth is not magically created or controlled, or the magic is from the druid herself.
## Deeper Roots
The druid gains the Black Tentacles spell and Thrashing Vines druid magic talent as a bonus spell and talent even if she would not qualify for the prerequisites. She may not cast Black Tentacles without the Thrashing Vines talent applied unless she later gains the prerequisite talents to cast Black Tentacles normally. If you already possess Black Tentacles or Thrashing vines you may instead select a bonus grasping vines or black tentacles talent you would qualify for.
## Deeper Bond
The druid’s rejection of metal becomes strong enough to allow them repel all metals away from themselves. The druid as a 2 AP action may spend a spell point to may cause creatures adjacent to them wearing metal armor, or wielding metal weapons to be subject to a bull rush reposition attempt to move them directly away from the druid (1d20 + the druid’s level + their CAM) in place of their normal MSB bonus. On a success creatures are pushed back 5 feet. For a number of rounds equal to the druid’s casting ability modifier after using this ability the druid gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC against metal weapons, and creatures wielding metal weapons or wearing metal armor treat all squares adjacent to the druid as difficult terrain. The druid may use this ability a number of times per day equal to her CAM.
## Greater Realm
The druid gains the power to return all to nature. As a 4 AP action the druid may spend 2 spell points to cause all metal objects in a 40 foot radius within long range to be immediately transformed from metal to wood. Magic objects made of metal receive a 20% spell resistance against this effect plus an additional 2% per BCB of the item. Weapons converted from metal take a -2 penalty on all attack and damage rolls, while armor treat their Armor bonus and Strength rating as 2 lower. Weapons that have been changed to wood by this splinter and break on any natural 1 on an attack roll, while armors have their AC reduced by 2, recalculating the hit points of the armor as appropriate.
