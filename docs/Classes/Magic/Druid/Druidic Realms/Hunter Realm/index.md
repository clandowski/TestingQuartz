## Root Power
When the druid uses her ironwood ability she may choose to summon any equipment onto a companion she controls within 30 feet. In addition the druid may use this ability to harden a natural weapon the creature possesses granting any benefits of the ironwood to the natural weapon. In addition, natural weapons targeted by this ironwood deal damage as if they were 1 size category larger and grant a +1 bonus to Physical saves against sunder combat maneuvers made against them. This bonus to Physical saves improves by an additional 1 at 10th and every 10 levels thereafter.

The druid may also use an instance of her Ironwood to grant her companion a natural armor bonus or enhance an existing natural armor bonus by 1 improving by 1 at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.

Ironwood applied to a companion she controls is treated as if it was in the druid’s possession for the determining if the ironwood would remain.
## Nature Stride
The druid’s movement becomes swift like an animal gaining a 5 foot bonus to their land speed increasing by an additional 5 per 5 druid levels.
## Deeper Roots
The druid companion grows becoming a more fantastical version of itself. The druid may apply one additional companion type to her companion in addition to its existing type; the druid must meet the prerequisites of this new type. The druid’s companion’s base intelligence score becomes equal to the druid’s intelligence score. The benefits only apply to a single companion; if the druid gains an additional companion she may apply these benefits instead to the newer companion but only if the newer companion also has the animal type.
## Deeper Bond
All beneficial spells cast by the druid on her companions are treated as if it is under the effects of the extend spell talent without increasing the spell point cost of the spell; this may not be combined with the extend spell talent. In addition any companion talents the druid applies to her companions that grant a bonus to an ability score grant an additional +1 to that ability score for every 4 levels the druid possesses.
## Greater Realm
The druid’s companion becomes a mythical beast of legend, gaining one additional companion talent, and companion type of her choice. In addition the druid doubles her bonuses to her BCB from improved realm for the purposes of determining the hit dice of her companion. These bonuses may only be applied to the companion benefitting from the deeper roots ability. This bonus to BCB and companion hit dice does not stack with sources from other classes or abilities that adjust the BCB or Hit dice of a companion.
