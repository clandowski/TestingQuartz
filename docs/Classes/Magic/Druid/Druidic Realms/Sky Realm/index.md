## Root Power
The druid’s ironwood weapons may be attuned to the element of wind. Weapons attuned to wind making ranged attacks add an additional 5 feet to the range increment of the weapon plus an additional 5 feet per 5 druid levels. Weapons attuned to wind reduce the ranged attack penalty from wind severity by 1 +1 per 4 druid levels (minimum 0).

Ironwood armor attuned to wind grants the druid a 5% miss chance against ranged attacks increasing by 5% per 5 druid levels. This miss chance stacks with other sources of miss chance, though cannot exceed 75%.
## Nature Stride
The druid reduces the speed adjustment of wind conditions by 10 + an additional 10 for every 4 druid levels she possesses (minimum 5) as long as the wind or weather is not magically created or controlled, or the magic is from the druid herself.
## Deeper Roots
The druid gains the Create Wall spell with the Wind wall talent if she did not already possess them. In addition the druid gains the Wall of Geysers druid talent talent as a bonus talent even if she does not qualify for it. The sky realm druid with this deeper roots power reduces the additional spell point cost of Wall of Geysers by 1.

If the druid  already possesses Wind wall she may select a different Create wall talent that she would qualify for.
## Deeper Bond
The druid is treated as if permanently under the effects of the feather fall spell. In addition, a number of times per day equal to the druid’s CAM she may call upon the effects of the Levitate talent of the slow fall spell even if she does not possess it as a natural spell, bypassing the usual spell point costs. The druid uses her levels in druid in place of her BCB & MSB for this natural spell to determine its effects. At 10th level the druid may use this ability without a limit to duration as long as she uses the talent’s ability to levitate across the ground.
## Greater Realm
The druid becomes a master of wind, capable of controlling the wind far beyond the powers of others. When casting a spell that creates or alters wind she may spend an additional spell point to allow the spell to go beyond Tier 5 winds (if her BCB or levels would allow the spell to do so), and instead becomes Tier 6 with the following effects (for example a 20 BCB druid casting wind wall would treat the winds within it as Tier 6):

|Wind Force Tier|Wind Speed|Speed Adjustment (Medium)|Fly Adjustment|Ranged Weapon Penalty (Medium)|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Tier 6 Wind|200+ mph|120 feet|24|-16|

In addition to the normal effects Tier 6 winds begin to affect melee attacks making it difficult to swing most melee weapons, applying half the ranged weapon penalty to melee attacks of creatures affected by the Tier 6 winds; if an effect would allow the creature to treat the wind tier severity as lower they do not suffer these effects.
