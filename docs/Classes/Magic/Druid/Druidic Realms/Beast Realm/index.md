## Root Power
The druid’s ironwood may take on the form of a pair of claws, granting the druid two claw weapons that deal 1d6 damage. These claws gain all the benefits of the druid’s ironwood equipment as normal.

If the druid already possesses claws or another natural weapon she may instead harden these natural weapons causing them to be treated as masterwork and apply any enhancement bonuses her ironwood would grant (if any). In addition, natural weapons targeted by this ironwood deal damage as if they were 1 size category larger and grant a +1 bonus to Physical saves against sunder combat maneuvers made against them. This bonus to Physical saves improves by an additional 1 at 10th and every 10 levels thereafter.

If the druid already possesses the polymorph weapon transformation talent she may create or reshape her ironwood to target her new natural weapons as a free action as part of casting the spell.

The druid may also use an instance of her Ironwood to grant herself a natural armor bonus or enhance an existing natural armor bonus by 1 improving by 1 at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.
## Nature Stride
The druid’s movement becomes swift like an animal gaining a 5 foot bonus to their land speed increasing by an additional 5 per 5 druid levels. This stacks with similar abilities from other druidic realms.
## Deeper Roots
The druid gains the Enduring transformation druid talent as a bonus magic talent. The druid selects a single form talent she possesses from the transformation spell. When using transformation she may only use the form talent she selected when gaining the benefits of enduring transformation, though may add traits from other forms as normal. In addition the druid gains one additional trait while in this form plus an additional trait at 10th level and every 10 levels of druid thereafter. If the druid already possesses Enduring transformation or later purchases it she may gain the benefits of enduring transformation with all form talents, not just the selected one; though she still only gains the additional traits with her selected form.
## Deeper Bond
The druid may select a single trait available to her from a form or alter talent she possesses, gaining its benefits even when not transformed. This trait does not count against her total number of traits allowed when using the transformation spell. The druid may choose to suppress or regain this trait as a full-round action.
## Greater Realm
The druid’s transformation spell is treated as if it is under the effects of the extend spell talent without increasing the spell point cost of the spell; this may not be combined with the extend spell talent. In addition may select a single companion talent she possesses the prerequisite affinity talent for, she may apply the benefits of this talent to herself while transformed; the druid gains no additional benefits from talents that grant the same bonus as one of her existing transformation traits, nor talents that grant an additional companion. The druid uses her own hit dice in place of companion hit dice to determine the power of the selected talent.
