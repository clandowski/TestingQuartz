# Class Features

The following are class features of the druid.

## Weapon and Armor Proficiency

Druids are proficient with club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. In addition druids are proficient with all simple light armor.

If this is the character’s first level in a class she gains proficiency in all light martial armor as well as all simple and martial shields.

## Casting

A druid may combine spells and talents to create magical effects; with her Casting Ability Modifier determined by her Druidic realm chosen at 1st level.

Druids are prohibited from using metal equipment such as armor, weapons, and shields. As such a druid must use items composed of wood, bone, or stone (usually weapons and armor with the wood or natural keywords). A druid who wears metal armor or uses a metal weapon is unable to cast spells or use any of her supernatural class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.

If this is the character’s first level in a casting class she gains a single discipline feat she qualifies for, may choose her <a href="/Magic%20Rules/Casting%20Type/">Casting Type</a> (See Casting Types on the Magic page), and may increase the casting time of a spell by 2 steps to ignore the spell failure caused by casting in light armor; if the druid possesses the armored caster feat she may instead use this ability to ignore the spell failure caused by casting in heavy armor.

## Caster’s Concentration

As a spellcaster, a Druid gains ranks in the Concentration skill equal to her class level.

## Spell Pool

A druid gains access to a magical source of energy known as a spell pool. This pool contains a number of spell points equal to her levels in casting classes + her casting ability modifier (minimum 1). This pool replenishes once per day after a long rest.

## Implements

A druid may choose any wooden object or a non-metal trophy (such as a necklace made of twine and animal tooth) as her implement. The druid may use her ironwood weapons as her implement.

## Magic Talents
A druid gains 1 magic talent every level, each magic talent may be used to learn a new talent or new spell the druid qualifies for. In addition she gains a bonus spell (but not talent) every 4 BCB she possesses.

## Druidic Realm (Su)

At 1st level the druid gains their choice of druidic realm that represents their focus as a druid.

If this is the character’s first level in a magic class, the druid gains the listed affinity talent and spell from her selected druidic realm,  If she already possesses the affinity talent she does not gain a replacement. If this is not the character’s first level in a magic class, the druid must select a druidic realm that grants an affinity talent they already possess or use her first talent granted from her druid level to purchase the appropriate talent.

In addition the Druidic Realm also determines the ability score used as the druid’s casting ability modifier, and the druid treats her BCB as equal to her levels in druid when casting a spell and determining what spells and talents she may qualify for of the associated affinity of her druidic realm.

At 3rd level the druid gains a second druidic realm of her choice gaining the listed affinity talent and spell if she does not already possess it. She does not use the casting modifier of her second druidic realm.

For a complete listing of druidic realms, see [[./Druidic Realms/index|Druidic Realms]]

## Ironwood (Su)

At 1st level a druid learns to strengthen wooden equipment to make it as strong as metal. The druid may spend a spell point as a 5 AP action to grow a wooden version of any equipment she is proficient with (such as a weapon, shield, or armor). This equipment, while made of wood, functions the same as their normal metal or wood counterparts without interfering with the druid’s casting. If the druid chooses to create armor using this ability she must still spend the time required to don the new armor.

A druid may choose to reshape her existing ironwood items into another a 4 AP action; this does not cost a spell point as when summoning a new piece of equipment. Reshaping existing ironwood does not heal any hit point damage it may have suffered; broken ironwood must be mended as normal equipment or have a new piece summoned.

This druid may maintain two ironwood items plus an additional at 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter. A druid may enhance any of her ironwood equipment as any other equipment; such as through enhancement gems and seals.

The druid cannot create additional ironwood items beyond her limit, and cannot create ironwood in locations without access to wood or significant plantlife (such as a wasteland, fully stone castle, or other structure). If the druid’s druidic realm would allow the druid to create their ironwood using a different material they must be in a location with the new material (such as fire) to create their new equipment using this material.

Ironwood equipment that leaves the druid’s possession for more than 1 minute returns to normal wood without the druid to maintain them. Due to the complexity of the equipment the druid is unable to make trigger keyword weapons out of ironwood.

If the druid chooses to make ammunition she creates 30 pieces of ammunition (such as arrows, bolts, etc..), replicating the hardness of any metal components of such ammunition. If a piece of ironwood equipment is destroyed, you cannot make a new piece of ironwood out of the destroyed ironwood equipment.

At 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter the druid may create their equipment as one masterwork quality higher than common (Uncommon at 5th, Rare at 9th, Exceptional at 13th and Legendary at 17th). In addition the druid may add any modifications the weapon would be capable of using given its types and modification slots as part of creating or reshaping the ironwood equipment.

## Whispers of Nature (Ex)

At 2nd level, a druid can improve the attitude of an animal. The druid may use a Diplomacy check at a -4 penalty to improve the attitude of the animal similar to using Diplomacy to improve the attitude of a person. Typical domestic animals have a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.

To use this ability, the druid and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. When starting wild empathy, if the check would successfully stop a creature from being hostile the creature may cease its attack, though the full minute of time must still be spent studying and communicating with the animal, and interruption may return the creature to a hostile state. A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a –6 penalty on the check.

## Druidic Focus (Su)

At 2nd level, the druid gains access to a druidic focus, allowing her to further their training as a druid and further define their connection to nature. The druid gains an additional druidic focus at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter. Additional Druidic Focus can be taken using the Extra Talent feat.

For a complete listing of druidic focus, see [[./List of Druidic Focus|List of Druidic Focus]]

## Root Power (Su)
At 3rd level, the druid gains the root power listed for her selected druidic realm enhancing the capabilities of her ironwood ability. At 6th level the druid gains the Root power of her second druidic realm. A druid may only apply the benefits of a single root power per piece of ironwood equipment, though may have a different root power on each individual piece. A root power may be applied to a piece of ironwood as part of creating or reshaping a piece of ironwood. If done as part of reshaping any existing root powers must be removed from the piece to apply the new one.

## Nature Stride (Ex)

Starting at 5th level, a druid gains the nature stride ability from her druidic realm. The druid gains the nature stride ability from her second druidic realm at 8th level.

The druid may as a 2 AP action grant the bonuses from this ability to one ally within 30 feet for a number of rounds equal to her CAM. At 6th level and every 2 levels thereafter she may affect an additional ally as part of this action. The druid may share these bonuses a number of times per day equal to her CAM.

## Deeper Roots (Ex)

At 7th level, the druid gains the Deeper Roots power listed for her selected druidic realm. At 10th level the druid gains the Deeper Roots of her second druidic realm.

## Nature’s Voice (Ex)

At 8th level the druid can communicate with animals, plants, and even stone as if she shared a language with them, and may ask them questions. Animals communicated with may provide answers to your questions, but may refuse depending on their current attitude towards you, or may give unhelpful answers if they are particularly unintelligent for an animal.

Rocks and plants may be communicated with and the druid may ask questions of and receive answers from them. A rock and plant’s sense of its surroundings is limited, so it won’t be able to answer questions about events outside its immediate vicinity. The plants or stone’s descriptions (or descriptions described to them) may not be detailed, though they can usually relay who or what touched them recently, objects under or behind them, and a rough approximation of days since when the events may have occurred.

The druid may use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to ½ her levels in druid plus her CAM.

## Improved Realm (Su)

At 9th level, the druid gains an improvement to her first realm she chose at 1st level gaining a Resist 1 against her realm’s affinity, as well as a +1 bonus to BCB and SPB when casting spells of the keyword of her realm’s affinity (such as Nature keyword spells with the plant realm). At 13th level these bonuses increase by an additional 1 plus an additional 1 every 6 levels thereafter.

The druid gains a +1 bonus to BCB and SPB for her second realm’s element at 12th level, 14th level and every 6 levels thereafter . If the druid has multiple realms with the same affinity talent she does not stack these bonuses together, but instead increases the overall bonus from this ability by +1 for each realm beyond the first with the same affinity talent.

## Deeper Bond (Su)

At 11th level, the druid gains the deeper bond ability of her druidic realm. At 14th level she gains the deeper bond of her second druidic realm.

## Body of Nature (Ex)

At 13th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up. In addition the druid gains immunity to all diseases.

## Greater Realm (Ex)

At 15th level, a druid gains the greater realm ability of her first druidic realm. At 18th level the druid gains the greater realm ability of her second druidic realm.

## Realm Mastery (Ex)

At 17th level, a druid gains immunity to the element of her first Druidic Realm’s affinity, as well as Resist 5 against any element her element is strong against. Due to her increased affinity the druid also gains weakness to (taking 50% additional damage) from any element her element is weak against.

## Nature’s Champion (Ex)

At 19th level, the druid becomes a master of nature, improving her bonuses from improved realm by an additional 1 for her first druidic realm, in addition the druid reduces weakness gained from Realm Mastery, reducing the additional damage from elemental weakness from 50% to 25%.

## Nature’s Avatar(Ex)

At 20th level, the druid becomes the avatar of her realm. For a number of rounds per day equal to the druid’s casting ability modifier plus half her levels in druid she becomes the true avatar of her realm. The druid may end this ability as a free action on her turn. While this ability is active the druid gains regeneration 5, as well is healed by all spell damage matching the associated damage type of her first druidic realm; any healing beyond the druid’s maximum hit points are instead applied to the druid as temporary hit points that last until the start of her next turn and may stack with themself. In addition creatures with an elemental type matching her druidic realm’s affinity have their disposition changed to friendly unless the druid performs or has performed a hostile action against the affected creature; this effect lasts even after this ability has ended.
