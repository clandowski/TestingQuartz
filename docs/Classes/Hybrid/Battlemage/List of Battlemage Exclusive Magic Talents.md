| Advanced Wield Elements | Wield Elemental, Battlemage 5th  | You may spend an additional spell point when casting wield elements to allow the spell to take the form of a melee weapon rather than a thrown weapon. The weapon takes on the form of a light weapon with the statistics of a dagger, one-handed weapon with the statistics of a longsword, or two handed weapon with the statistics of a greatsword. These deal damage and are always sized appropriately for the creature wielding them, but always target touch AC with their attack rolls instead of normal AC, using CAM instead of strength on damage rolls as usual for wield element.<br><br>This form of wield element does not have a limited number of attacks and instead lasts the full duration of the spell, but the damage die size does not improve at the normal interval, keeping the damage die of the weapon form chosen.<br><br>While this weapon may be used with two weapon fighting, only a single melee weapon may be summoned with this ability at one time, requiring an additional casting of this spell to summon a second one.<br><br>You are not considered armed for the purposes of threatening squares when using the weapon from this ability. |
| Igniting Strike         | Elemental Weapon, Battlemage 5th | Once per round as a reaction as part of making an attack, you may spend one additional spell point to activate elemental weapon as part of the attack. Doing grants the benefits of elemental weapon on that attack as well as the normal duration of elemental weapon.<br><br>This talent may not be used with an attack benefitting from the spellstrike universal talent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
