| Blade of the Elements          | \-                                                               | The battlemage learns to summon a blade of a metallic or crystalline form of solid elemental energy. The battlemage may summon this blade as a reaction by spending mystic pool point. The weapon summoned with this ability is treated as the wield element spell with the Batlemage’s advanced wield element talent applied with the following differences. The battlemage may choose to increase the cost of this ability by 1 to summon two weapons at once. This weapon’s damage is treated as half slashing and half of the type matching the associated damage type of the affinity talent granted by his currently active elemental stance; this does not include lingering stances from the elemental blending class feature. When using this ability the battlemage is treated as armed for the purposes of threatening squares with a weapon from this ability. Attacks with these weapons target AC instead of touch AC, and the weapon lasts 1 hour per battlemage level. If the battlemage currently has no active stance this blade insead deals all slashing damage until one is entered.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Greater Runeforged             | Runeforged Battlemage Specialization, Battlemage 11th            | The battlemage now doubles the number of spells he may have inscribed at one time, but each piece of equipment is limited to 2 + 1 per 3 levels after 4th; requiring any remaining inscribed spells to be placed on different equipment. The battlemage may also activate a spell as a reaction when striking an enemy with a weapon etched with spells, or when struck while wearing armor etched with spells; though the battlemage is still limited to activating one inscribed spell per round with this ability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Greater War Forged             | War Forged Battlemage Specailization, Battlemage 11th            | The battlemage’s focus is unparalleled in combat allowing him to cast in nearly any situation. When a foe provokes an attack of opportunity from the battlemage, and it is not currently his turn, the battlemage may make a concentration check to cast defensively; if he succeeds he may cast a single spell of a 4 AP or less upon the foe who provoked the attack of opportunity. Upon using this ability the battlemage is staggered during his next turn. The battlemage may only use this ability once per round.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Improved Blade of the Elements | Blade of the Elements Battlemage Specialization, Battlemage 11th | The battlemage learns to summon a more pure version of his elemental blades, turning them into both a hybrid of solid weapons and elemental energy. The battlemage’s blade of elements deals additional weapon damage dice of damage on hit; this is treated as additional damage and not an increase to the base weapon damage dice for the purposes of abilities that modify or multiply weapon damage dice.<br><br>In addition when making an attack against a foe, and in an elemental stance, if the battlemage’s attack misses the creature’s AC, but would still hit the creature’s touch AC the creature takes half damage from the attack. This damage is all of a type matching the stance’s affinity damage type rather than the usual damage split.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Runeforged                     | \-                                                               | The runforged battlemage has learned to etch runes into his equipment allowing him to store spells within his equipment for later use. The battlemage may etch one spell onto his weapons or armor with 10 minutes of work, casting the spell along with any spell points required for the spell. The battlemage may have up to 2 spells etched onto his equipment at once plus an additional 1 for every 3 levels of battlemage after 4th. The battlemage may choose to activate an etched spell as a 2 AP action, casting the spell and removing the etched spell from the equipment; a battlemage may activate only one spell this way per round. Armor or weapons gain a +1 enhancement bonus for each spell etched upon them; this does not stack with any enhancement bonus the item already possesses, taking the greater of the two enhancement bonuses.<br><br>Once etched, spells may remain etched upon the armor until the battlemage rests and regains spell points unless the battlemage chooses to destroy the etching as a 4 AP action.<br><br>A battlemage may etch spells onto his equipment as part of preparing spells if he is a prepared spellcaster, and may etch and activate etched spells even if he does not have the correct affinity talent currently active from one of his stances. |
| War Forged                     | \-                                                               | The war caster battlemage has learned to let nothing break his focus in the heat of battle. The battlemage adds his levels in battlemage as a competence bonus to all concentration checks he makes At 5th level the battlemage treats all damage he takes as half when determining the DC of a concentration checks from damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
