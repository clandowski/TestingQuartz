# Class Features

The following are class features of the Battlemage.
## Weapon and Armor Proficiency

Battlemages are proficient with all simple weapons and simple armor.

If this is the character’s first level in a class he gains proficiency in all martial weapons and martial armor.
## Casting

A battlemage may combine spells and talents to create magical effects, and uses Intelligence as his Casting Ability Modifier.

If this is the character’s first level in a casting class he gains a single discipline feat he qualifies for, may choose his <a href="/Magic%20Rules/Casting%20Type/">Casting Type</a> (See Casting Types on the Magic page), and may increase the casting time of a spell by 2 steps to ignore the spell failure caused by casting in light armor; if the battlemage possesses the armored caster feat he may instead use this ability to ignore the spell failure caused by casting in heavy armor.
# Mystic Pool

A battlemage learns to push their natural energies to create both the magical and extraordinary. This pool contains a number of points equal to his levels in battlemage. A mystic pool may be used as a stamina or a spell point pool, though it does not stack with either when determining the size of either pool. Similar to a stamina and spell point pool, a mystic pool restores itself after a long rest.

At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter the mystic pool’s size increases by an additional 1. If he obtains a mystic pool from another class or source he may combine the pools and their levels to determine the total capacity of the mystic pool. If this is the character’s first level in a class their mystic pool’s capacity increases by an additional 2.

Classes with a mystic pool count as both Martial and Casting classes for the purposes of determining MPB and SPB, and if this is their first level in a martial or magic class.
## Implements

A battlemage may choose a staff, amulet, or spellbook as his implement. In addition, the battlemage may create a magical bond with a masterwork quality weapon as an implement in a ritual that takes 1 hour and consumes exotic spell reagents costing 100 gp per SPB. The battlemage may have only one bonded weapon at a time, and only the most recently bonded weapon functions as the battlemage’ implement.
## Magic Talents

A battlemage gains 1 magic talent at every time he gains 1 BCB from his battlemage level, each magic talent may be used to learn a new talent or new spell the battlemage qualifies for.
## Elemental Stance (Su)

At 1st level, the battlemage selects a single elemental stance.

This elemental stance, while active, grants the battlemage a single affinity talent, and the specific essence or anima of that affinity talent, listed on the elemental stance. In addition each elemental stance has an associated stance feat; granting the benefits of this stance and counting as this stance feat for the purposes of meeting prerequisites. When not in this stance the battlemage no longer possesses this affinity talent or the associated stance feat. If the battlemage is a prepared caster, he may prepare spells for any affinity talent he may access from his stances even if that stance is not currently active; but may not cast that prepared spell until he is granted the affinity talent from his current elemental stance.

Entering an elemental stance requires a reaction at the start of the turn, similar to entering a normal stance feat; activating a different elemental stance or stance feat immediately ends the current Elemental Stance. Elemental stances may not be combined with feats or abilities that allow multiple stances to be activated at the same time. Once a battlemage has left an elemental stance he may not re-enter an elemental stance he has left for 2 rounds.

If the battlemage gains the expanded affinity feat, they may select affinity talents granted by their elemental stance, and gain the benefits of both the essence and anima of their affinity talent of the elemental stance while the selected stance is active.

At 2nd level and every 5 levels thereafter the battlemage gains access to one additional elemental stance.

For a complete listing of elemental stances, see [[./List of Elemental Stances|List of Elemental Stances]]
## Hybrid Training (Ex)

At 2nd level, and at every 4 levels thereafter, a battlemage gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as Martial feats or Magic feats. The Battlemage may also choose feats from those listed as combat feats, but is limited to one combat feat for every 4 battlemage levels he possesses for the number of combat feats he may select with this class feature.
## Elemental Blending (Su)

At 3rd level, when a battlemage changes stances he retains the benefits and abilities of the stance he just left for 1 round. In addition each time the battlemage enters a new stance without repeating a stance in sequence he gains a cumulative +1 morale bonus to all attack and damage rolls. This bonus is reset to +0 when he enters a stance he has already entered in the sequence or does not enter a new stance for 2 rounds.

For example if a battlemage has 3 stances he may start with Roaring Flames stance, then change to Rushing Winds stance gaining the +1 morale bonus; then switching to Umbral Stance would improve this bonus to +2. If the battlemage then entered Roaring Flames stance the bonus would reset to +0 and he would begin accruing the bonus again upon entering Rushing Winds or Umbral stance.
## Stance Spell (Su)

At 3rd level, the Battlemage may select a single elemental stance he possesses. The battlemage may select a single spell matching the affinity talent of the selected elemental stance. While in this stance the battlemage gains access to this spell. If the spell is one that has no base affinity, but instead has a talent related to the affinity talent used (such as conjure wall); you learn the spell and the related talent as part of this (Such as Conjure wall and Wall of Fire for fire affinity).

If a prepared caster the battlemage may choose to change one of their known spells to a stance spell and instead learn a new spell in its place. In addition the battlemage may learn talent for the selected spell, though can only access the spell if in the associated stance.

At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the battlemage may choose a different elemental stance or the same stance, learning a new spell each time. The same spell may be selected more than once but only for different elemental stances, and only if the spell would be an appropriate selection for the affinity talent of the selected stance.
## Battlemage Specialization (Su)

At 4th and 11th level, a battlemage learns to become more specialized at his style of combat, further drawing upon the strengths of himself and his magics. A battlemage selects one of the following specializations he qualifies for:

See [[./List of Battlemage Specializations|List of Battlemage Specializations]]

## Practiced Spellcasting (Su)

Starting at 5th level, a battlemage learns through practical application rather than study to improve upon the magics of a single spell. The battlemage selects a single spell he is capable of casting, when casting this spell he may treat his BCB as 1 higher for the purposes of the effects and power of this spell. For every 4 levels after 5th the battlemage improves this bonus by an additional 1.

At 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter the battlemage may select 1 additional spell to apply these bonuses to.

## Battlemage's Flexibility

At 7th level, a battlemage learns to improve upon his elemental stances. For each elemental stance the battlemage possesses he gains a bonus feat for that with the associated stance as a prerequisite; if the battlemage already had this feat through his normal feat progression or his hybrid training class feature he may automatically retrain that feat to another appropriate feat. The battlemage gains the benefits of this bonus feat only while in the elemental stance that would grant him the associated stance feat. When the battlemage gains a new elemental stance he gains a bonus feat for the new elemental stance's associated stance feat.

In addition, when the battlemage changes stances he may choose to change any ongoing spell effect he cast (such as the wield element, elemental weapon, or elemental shell) to match his new stance's element. This changes the spell to be treated as if he had cast it with that stance's elemental affinity talent, though affects nothing else about the spell (such as duration, talents applied, or other such effects). The affinity talent must be a valid option that could've been applied to the spell for the spell or talents chosen when it was cast (for example if the battlemage applied frigid blast to a spell it could no longer have other elemental affinity talents applied to it as it could not have been cast without cold affinity). If the spell would be one such as elemental wall that has a selection of talents based on the affinity used with the spell, the battlemage must possess the talent (such as switching from Fire to Cold the battlemage must possess the Wall of Fire and Wall of Ice talent for the spell to take on the effects of the new wall.)
## Stance Blending (Su)

At 13th level, when a battlemage changes stances he retains the benefits and abilities of the stance he just left for 1 round, plus an additional round at 17th level.
## Perfected Spellcasting (Su)

At 15h level, the battlemage learns to become more specialized as a spellcaster, selecting a single spell he has selected with his practiced spellcasting class feature. The battlemage reduces the AP cost to cast the spell by 1 (minimum 1 AP).
## Greater Pool (Su)

At 16th level the battlemage’s focus and might grows, granting him more power throughout the day.

If the battlemage is a spontaneous spellcaster he may add his casting ability modifier (minimum 1) to the capacity of his Mystic Pool.

If the battlemage is a prepared spellcaster the battlemage gains a number of additional slots to prepare spells each day equal to his casting ability modifier.
## Favored Stance (Su)

At 19th level, the battlemage may select one elemental stance that he knows. If the favored stance is the last stance in the sequence he may retain the bonuses from elemental blending for 2 rounds after starting a new sequence; this does not stack with the morale bonus from the new sequence.
## Warmage (Su)

At 20th level, the battlemage ascends to a mage of war, having seen countless battles. The battlemage improves the bonus from practiced spellcasting by an additional +2; and the AP adjustment from Perfected Spellcasting by an additional 1. In addition, the battlemage successfully casts defensively he gains the benefits of the total defense action.
# Battlemage Exclusive Magic Talents

Some classes have access to exclusive magic talents to further modify a spell in a unique way for their class.
