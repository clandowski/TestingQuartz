# Class Features

The following are class features of the Magus.
## Weapon and Armor Proficiency

Magus are proficient with all simple weapons and simple armor. If this is the character’s first level in a class he gains proficiency in all martial weapons and martial armor.
## Casting

A magus may combine spells and talents to create magical effects, and uses Intelligence or Psyche as his Casting Ability Modifier.

If this is the character’s first level in a casting class he gains a single discipline feat he qualifies for, may choose his <a href="/Magic%20Rules/Casting%20Type/">Casting Type</a> (See Casting Types on the Magic page), and may increase the casting time of a spell by 2 AP to ignore the spell failure caused by casting in light armor; if the magus possesses the armored caster feat he may instead use this ability to ignore the spell failure caused by casting in heavy armor.
## Magus’s Training

A magus may choose a single Strength, Agility, or Endurance based skill; they gain an additional bonus rank in this chosen skill for each level in magus.
## Mystic Pool

A magus learns to push their natural energies to create both the magical and extraordinary. This pool contains a number of points equal to his levels in magus. A mystic pool may be used as a stamina or a spell point pool, though it does not stack with either when determining the size of either pool. Similar to a stamina and spell point pool, a mystic pool restores itself after a long rest.

At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter the mystic pool’s size increases by an additional 1. If he obtains a mystic pool from another class or source he may combine the pools and their levels to determine the total capacity of the mystic pool. If this is the character’s first level in a class their mystic pool’s capacity increases by an additional 2.

Classes with a mystic pool count as both Martial and Casting classes for the purposes of determining MPB and SPB, and if this is their first level in a martial or magic class.
## Implements

A magus may choose a staff, amulet, or spellbook as his implement. In addition, the magus may create a magical bond with a masterwork quality weapon as an implement in a ritual that takes 1 hour and consumes exotic spell reagents costing 100 gp per SPB. The magus may have only one bonded weapon at a time, and only the most recently anointed weapon functions as the magus’ implement.
## Magic Talents

A magus gains 1 magic talent at every time he gains 1 BCB from his magus level, each magic talent may be used to learn a new talent or new spell the magus qualifies for. In addition, he gains a bonus spell (but not talent) for every 6 BCB he gains from this class.
## Spellblade Focus Initiate (Su)

At 1st level, a magus gains the spellstrike meta universal talent as a bonus magic talent.

In addition the magus learns to further hone their capabilities in combat, electing to embrace a single style of combat. The magus selects a single Spellblade Focus. If this is the magus’s first level in a martial class he gains the associated stance as a bonus feat, and if this is the magus’s first level in a casting class he gains associated affinity as a bonus talent.

For a complete listing of spellblade focus, see [[./Spellblade Focus/index|Spellblade Focus]]
## Mystic Combat (Su)

At 2nd level, a magus may reduce the AP cost any spell which normally requires a 4 AP or less to cast by 2 AP (minimum 1 AP), but may only target himself with any spell cast in this manner. When casting in this way the magus does not provoke attacks of opportunity for casting. The magus may use this ability once per day for each level of magus he possesses.
## Practiced Arcana

At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter the magus gains access to a special ability known as an arcana; allowing the magus to further enhance their blending of martial and magic prowess. Unless otherwise specified a magus arcana can only be selected once. Abilities that call for ki may be instead utilized by spending 1 point from his mystic pool if he does not yet possess a ki pool. Additional Practiced Arcana can be taken using the Extra Talent feat.

For a complete listing of Practiced Arcana, see [[./List of Practiced Arcana|List of Practiced Arcana]]
## Basic Spellblade Focus (Su)

At 3rd level the magus gains the benefits of the listed basic training of their spellblade focus.
## Ki Pool (Su)

At 3rd level, a Magus gains access to a pool of internal energies called ki, which allow him to perform supernatural feats that go beyond the limits of his physical body. This pool contains a number of ki points equal 1 + his casting ability modifier (minimum 2) and refreshes once per day when the Magus regains his Mystic Pool. A Magus may spend a stamina or a mystic pool point as a free action on his turn to regain 2 points of his ki pool.

As long as the Magus has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he gains an enhancement bonus on athletics checks to jump equal to his class level, and his unarmed strikes and natural attacks are treated as magic weapons. At 8th level, his unarmed strikes and natural attacks are treated as silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

In addition at 3rd level a magus expands his repertoire of his Ki Pool allowing him to spend his ki points in additional ways:

- Ki Reflexes: Spend a ki point in place of a reaction.
- Ki Dodge: Once per round, spend a ki point as a reaction to gain a +4 dodge bonus to AC for 1 round.
- Ki Leap: Once per round, spend a ki point as a reaction to gain a +20 enhancement bonus to athletics checks made to jump for 1 round, and to be considered as having a running start when making such a check.

If a magus gains a ki pool from another source, he does not combine the pools for the purposes of determining capacity, nor does he gain an additional ki pool, but may spend points from his ki pool to pay for abilities from either source that require ki points. If each pool requires different ability scores (such as Psyche and Focus) the Magus may use the higher of the two ability scores when determining the capacity of his ki pool. The Magus may add together his levels in all classes that grant a ki pool to determine the abilities of his ki pool class feature.
## Improved Blade Magic (Su)

At 4th level the magus learns to weave his spells even more fluidly into his attacks. He gains advanced spellstrike as a bonus feat. If the magus already has advanced spellstrike or later gains advanced spellstrike again he may instead reduce the AP cost of any spell cast through spellstrike by 2 (minimum 3 AP).
## Spellblade Magics (Su)
At 6th level and every 6 levels thereafter the magus may select a single bonus talent listed as part of his Spellblade Focus and gains it. The magus does not need to meet the prerequisites of this spell or talent except for the level requirement listed on the Spellblade Focus if specified. If the magus lacks the specific spell needed for that talent, the magus may still gain that talent, but may not use it until he has the requisite spell to apply it to.
## Improved Spellblade Focus (Su)

At 7th level the magus gains the benefits of the improved training from the Spellblade Focus he selected at 3rd level.
## Greater Blade Magic (Su)

At 9th level when casting a spell through spellstrike the magus may choose to spend 1 additional mystic pool point and increase the AP cost of the spellstrike by 1 (minimum 4 AP) to cast the spell twice paying the usual spell point cost of the spell as normal. Doing so causes both spells to manifest at -4 BCB, and are resolved as part of two separate melee attacks rather than as one.

## Spellblade Arcana (Su)

At 10th level the magus gains access to a powerful type of arcana known as a spellblade arcana. The magus may select a single spellblade arcana from the spellblade focus he selected at 3rd level. At every 5 levels after 10th the magus against access to one additional Spellblade Arcana.
## Master Blade Magic (Su)

At 11th level the magus gains quicken spell as a bonus magic talent if he did not already possess it. Once per round on the Magus’ turn the magus may use quicken spell to make an attack with spellstrike as a reaction. When using spellstrike with quicken spell the attack is not treated as a focused attack.
## Advanced Spellblade Focus (Su)

At 13th level the magus gains the benefit of advanced training from the Spellblade Focus he selected at 3rd level.
## Greater Pool (Su)

At 16th level the magus’s focus and might grows, granting him more power throughout the day. The magus may add half of his casting ability modifier (rounded down, minimum 1) to the capacity of his Mystic Pool and his ki pool.
## Master Spellblade Focus (Su)

At 17th level the magus gains the benefit of master training from the Spellblade Focus he selected at 3rd level.
## Grand Blade Magic (Su)

At 19th level the magus automatically passes all concentration checks to avoid losing a spell from damage or ongoing damage for any spell used with spellstrike. The magus is still subject to all other concentration checks such as from weather conditions.
## Mythic Spellblade Focus (Su)

At 20th level the magus gains the benefits of the Mythic Training from the Spellblade Focus he selected at 3rd level.
