## Basic Training
While in whirlwind stance, and wielding a weapon with the balanced keyword in each hand, the magus may treat the weapon in his offhand as a light weapon for the purposes of determining the penalties from two weapon fighting.
## Improved Training
While in whirlwind stance, and wielding a weapon with the balanced keyword in each hand, the magus may make a single attack with his off-hand taking the usual penalties for two-weapon fighting with an off-hand weapon when making a spellstrike.

When using spellstrike in this way the magus may choose to reduce the BCB of the spell by half (minimum 1) to allow the effects of the spell to be applied to both his main-hand and off-hand attack, as long as he attacks two separate creatures with this main and off-hand attack. When the magus gains Greater blade magic he may choose to make the second spell strike as part of an additional attack made as part of a focused attack.
## Advanced Training
While in whirlwind stance, the magus is treated as if he had moved more than 5 feet, for the purposes of whirlwind stance or any feat with whirlwind stance as a prerequisite, anytime he makes an attack with both his main and off hand weapon in the same turn.
## Master Training
The magus gains spell resistance equal to his concealment chance from whirlwind stance if he is currently benefiting from it. Effects that allow a creature to bypass or reroll against this concealment allow the creature to also bypass or reroll against this spell resistance.
## Mythic Training
While in whirlwind stance, the magus gains a +3 bonus to BCB when making an attack with spellstrike with his main-hand and off-hand weapon using Improved Training from Whirling Dervish; and the magus may choose to attack the same creature rather than two separate creatures using this ability.
## Spellblade Magics
The Magus may select one of the following bonus talents using their spellblade magics class feature: Elemental Weapon, Elemental Blast, Improved Elemental Blast, Air Geyser
## Spellblade Arcana
Listed below are the spellblade arcana available to the whirling dervish spellblade focus:

- **Dimensional Dervish (Magus 10th)**: As a 5 AP action the magus may spend 1 point from his mystic pool to make a focused attack while teleporting. The magus may designate one foe within 5 feet per magus level, teleporting adjacent that foe and making his first attack of a focused attack action. The magus then may continue his focused attack on the same creature, or designate another creature within 30 feet of the first to teleport to and make an additional attack. The magus may make as many attacks as normally allowed by a focused attack action that 5 AP was spent on and teleport an equal number of times.
- **Arcane Dervish (Magus 10th)**: As a reaction the magus may spend 2 points from his ki pool when making a focused attack to reduce the AP cost of one of his additional attacks by 1 (minimum 0), and reduces the cumulative penalty gained for making additional attacks by 1 until the start of his next turn.
- **Elemental Whirl (Magus 15th)**: The magus may spend 1 point from his mystic pool to use spellstrike with a spell that targets an area. When doing so the magus treats himself as the targeted square of the spell. The magus may choose to exclude himself from the effects of the spell. Instead of an attack roll creatures are subject to a reflex save attack (using his normal save attack for a spell) success causes creatures within the area to take damage as if hit by the magusâ€™s main-hand and off-hand weapon, failure instead deals half. In addition creatures are subject to the effects of the spell on a success, though if the spell calls for a fortitude or will saving throw they must make additional saves against the same save attack of this ability. If the spell calls for a reflex use the results of the save attack to determine results instead of the creature rolling reflex again.
