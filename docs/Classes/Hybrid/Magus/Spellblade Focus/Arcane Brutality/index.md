- **Bonus Stamce**: Power Stance 
- **Bonus Affinity**: Fire (Essence) Affinity
## Basic Training
When wielding a two-handed weapon the magus may add the damage bonus from power stance to any spell cast using spellstrike even if the spell would not normally deal damage.
## Improved Training
When in power stance and attempting a combat maneuver with a two handed weapon, the magus may spend 1 point from his ki pool as part of the combat maneuver to count his BAB from his magus levels as equal to his magus level for the purposes of determining his MSB for that combat maneuver.
## Advanced Training
When in power stance and wielding a two handed weapon the magus ignores a number of points of elemental damage reduction from elemental resist equal to his damage bonus from power stance (this includes the increase from wielding a weapon in two hands)
## Master Training
The magus gains Vital strike as a bonus feat if he did not already possess it. When casting a spell to use through spellstrike as a 3 AP action or greater, the magus may increase the AP cost of this ability by 1 to replace the melee attack with a vital strike (allowing further AP to be spent to further improve the vital strike).

If used with the brutal explosion or brutal eruption Spellblade arcana the area damaged by these abilities improves by an additional 5 feet plus 5 feet per additional AP spent on the vital strike. If the magus already possesses vital strike when gaining this ability or later gains it he further increases the area with these abilities by an additional 5 feet plus 5 feet per additional AP spent on the vital strike.
## Mythic Training
When in power stance and wielding a two-handed weapon the magus may attempt a sunder combat maneuver against a creature using spellstrike, as if targeting a creature’s natural armor (even if they do not possess natural armor). If he succeeds the creature gains vulnerability to the associated damage type of the spell used with the spellstrike, and the creature’s spell resistance is reduced by 20%. This penalty lasts until the creature is healed or recovers hit points naturally (such as through rest).
## Spellblade Magics
The Magus may select one of the following bonus talents using their spellblade magics class feature: Elemental Weapon, Elemental Blast, Improved Elemental Blast, Alter Self
## Spellblade Arcana
Listed below are the spellblade arcana available to the arcane brutality spellblade focus:

- **Brutal Explosion (Magus 10th)**: The magus may spend 1 point from his ki pool when making an attack to cause creatures adjacent to the target, excluding the magus, to take damage equal to the weapon damage die of the weapon used in the attack. This decision must be made before the attack roll is made, and if the magus’s attack misses the effect does not occur and the ki pool points are still spent.
- **Brutal Aura (Magus 10th)**: The magus may spend 1 point from his ki pool as a reaction to treat all weapons wielded as one size category larger for the purposes of the damage they deal. In addition the magus treats the reach of any melee weapon he is wielding as 5 feet longer than normal. These effects increase by an additional 1 size category of damage, and 5 feet of reach at 15th level and every 5 levels thereafter. This effect lasts until the start of the magus’s next turn.
- **Brutal Eruption (Magus 15th)**: The magus may spend 1 point from his mystic pool to use spellstrike with a spell that targets an area. When doing so the magus treats himself as the targeted square of the spell. The magus may choose to exclude himself from the effects of the spell. Instead of an attack roll creatures are subject to a reflex save attack (using his normal save attack for a spell); success causes creatures within the area to take damage as if hit by the magus’s weapon, failure instead deals half. In addition creatures are subject to the effects of the spell on a success, though if the spell calls for a fortitude or will saving throw they must make additional saves against the same save attack of this ability. If the spell calls for a reflex use the results of the save attack to determine results instead of the creature rolling reflex again.
