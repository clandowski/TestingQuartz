- **Bonus Stamce**: Defensive Stance 
- **Bonus Affinity**: Earth (Water-Anima) Affinity
## Basic Training
The magus gains Armored Caster a second time as a bonus feat. If the magus already possesses this feat or gains it later he may add half his armor bonus, up to maximum equal to his magus level, to his touch AC and CMD; this ability stacks with similar abilities such as the nimble property of armor; this bonus only applies while the magus is in defense stance.
## Improved Training
While in defensive stance, the magus may use his mystic combat ability as part of taking a total defense action without increasing the AP cost. At 8th level the magus gains two additional uses of mystic combat per day.
## Advanced Training
When in defensive stance, the magus gains 5% spell resistance for every 4 magus levels he possesses when he takes the total defense action. If the magus takes a 4 AP action to total defense this spell resistance is doubled.
## Master Training
Once per round, while in defensive stance, if the magus is struck by an attack after taking the total defense action he may spend 1 point from his mystic pool to cast a single spell with spellstrike against the creature who struck the magus as a reaction. The magus may only use this ability against creatures within his reach to successfully complete the attack.
## Mythic Training
The magus learns to extend the benefits of his mystic combat to his allies. The magus may target one adjacent ally instead of himself as the target of a mystic combat spell he is attempting to cast. In addition, each time the magus uses his mystic combat ability he gains a +2 dodge bonus to his AC until the start of his next turn.
## Spellblade Magics
The Magus may select one of the following bonus talents using their spellblade magics class feature: Elemental Blast, Improved Elemental Blast, Elemental Shell, Conjure Wall
## Spellblade Arcana
Listed below are the spellblade arcana available to the arcane knight spellblade focus

- **Arcane Rebuff (Magus 10th)**: The magus may spend 1 point from his ki pool as a reaction when any ally within 30 feet, other than the magus, is damaged by an attack. The magus may reduce the damage by an amount equal to half his magus level.
- **Arcane Guardian (Magus 10th)**: When adjacent to another ally the magus may spend 1 point from his ki pool as a reaction to redirect an attack targeting an adjacent ally to himself. When doing so the magus may treat his armor’s AC bonus as 1 higher for every 5 magus levels he possesses for the purposes of determining how much damage he may redirect to his armor.
- **Arcane Fortress (Magus 15th)**: The magus may spend 1 point from his mystic pool as a 3 AP action. For 1 minute per magus level whenever an ally within 30 feet of the magus takes damage the magus may redirect a number of points of damage equal to his Armor’s AC bonus to himself as a reaction. The magus may redirect this damage to his armor as normal. The magus may not use this ability against the same attack he redirected with Arcane Guardian.
