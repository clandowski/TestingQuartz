- **Bonus Stamce**: Defensive Stance 
- **Bonus Affinity**: Air (Essence) Affinity
## Basic Training
When in defensive stance, and wielding a shield, the magus reduces the penalties for fighting defensively by half when making an attack with his shield through a spellstrike. The magus takes penalties as normal for fighting defensively when attacking with a weapon that isn’t a shield, or with an attack not through a spellstrike.
## Improved Training
As a 3 AP  action the magus may spend 1 point from his ki pool to imbue his shield with a single spell, spending any spell points or other resources as part of casting at this time. Once imbued the spell remains imbued in the shield for 10 minutes per magus level. When a creature attempts to hit the magus with a melee attack and misses, or the magus successfully hits the creature with the shield, he may as a reaction expend the spell imbued within his shield casting and targeting the creature. The spell is treated as if it had successfully hit if it requires a touch attack. Once the spell has been cast from the shield the shield is no longer imbued.

This may only be used with spells that target a single creature for their effect. If the spell calls for a saving throw you must still make a save attack as normal to determine the effect of the spell. Spells imbued with this ability may not be modified with meta talents. Only one spell may be imbued in a shield at a time.

When casting a spell using spellstrike, the magus may choose to imbue his shield instead of casting the spell on the creature he is attacking.
## Advanced Training
While a spell is imbued in the magus’s shield he magus gains a +3 deflection bonus to his AC. In addition the magus gains Resist 2 against the affinity talent of the imbued spell. This resist improves by an additional 1 at 15th level and 20th level.
## Master Training
The magus may have up to two spells imbued in his shield at one time, though he may only expend a single spell at a time as a reaction. This applies the resist and DR of the magus’s advanced training for each unique affinity spell imbued in the shield.
## Mythic Training
The magus may now expend the spell imbued within his shield against any creature who misses him with a melee or ranged attack as long as the creature is within 30 feet + 5 feet per 2 magus levels. In addition anytime a creature misses the magus with an attack the creature takes 1d6 damage of a single element of the magus’s choice matching the associated damage type of the affinity talent of a single spell imbued within his shield; this damage only occurs if the magus choses to not expend the imbued spell as an reaction.
## Spellblade Magics
The Magus may select one of the following bonus talents using their spellblade magics class feature: Elemental Blast, Improved Elemental Blast, Elemental Shell, Phalanx
## Spellblade Arcana
Listed below are the spellblade arcana available to the shield magus spellblade focus:

- **Shield Ward (Magus 10th)**: When the magus’s shield is imbued and he takes a full defense action as a 4 AP action the magus may spend 1 point from his ki pool to cause his shield to emit a barrier until the start of his next turn. While this barrier is active all squares adjacent to the magus are treated as difficult terrain, in addition allies may treat these squares as obstacles for the purposes of determining cover from ranged attacks.
- **Shield Absorb (Magus 10th)**: Once per round when targeted by a spell the magus may spend 1 point from his mystic pool as an reaction to attempt to absorb it into a wielded shield. The magus makes an attempt to dispel (1d20+ your SPB) the spell (against the caster 1d20+ the caster’s SPB). If your check is higher the effect is dispelled and is absorbed into the magus’s shield, causing it to be imbued with the spell. If the magus already has a spell within his shield he may choose to harmlessly discharge the spell to allow the new spell to take its place.
- **Mystic Absorb (Magus 10th)**: The magus may use his mystic combat to imbue his shield with a spell as a move action, but may only imbue spells that he normally would be able to cast with mystic combat.  When the magus uses this ability he may instead the magus may expend the spell to cast the spell imbued within on himself.
- **Imbued Bulwark (Magus 15th)**: Each time an attack roll is made against the magus, the magus may choose to reduce the BCB of the spell imbued within the shield by 1 to improved the Deflection Bonus from his advanced training by 1 until the start of his next turn. If the BCB of the spell is reduced to 0 the spell is lost and the shield is no longer treated as imbued.
