- **Bonus Stamce**: Duelist Stance 
- **Bonus Affinity**: Water (Essence) Affinity

## Basic Training
When in duelist stance, the magus gains a +1 competence bonus to AC. This bonus improves by 1 at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter. The magus loses this bonus until the start of his next turn if he wields or makes an attack with an off-hand weapon.
## Improved Training
When in duelist stance, when the magus successfully hits with an attack using spellstrike, the magus may make a single bonus attack at a -2 penalty. The magus may not make an attack with an off-hand weapon when using this ability.
## Advanced Training
When in duelist stance, and wielding nothing in their off hand, the magus may spend 1 point from their ki pool as a reaction to add half their magus level to all their weapon damage rolls for 1 minute. This effect ends if the magus ends their duelist stance, or makes an attack with a weapon in their off hand.
## Master Training
When in duelist stance, when the magus makes an attack he gains 5% spell resistance. This bonus improves by 5% at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter. This effect ends if the magus ends their duelist stance, or makes an attack with a weapon in their off hand.
## Mythic Training
When in duelist stance, the magus gains a stacking +1 competence bonus to attack rolls and save attack rolls for each successful attack he makes against a single target against that target; this bonus lasts until the start of their next turn. The magus loses this bonus if he wields or makes an attack with a weapon in his off-hand.

In addition when the magus critically strikes with an attack made with spelstrike he adds ½ his magus level to the damage of the attack; adding this an additional time per critical multiplier above x2 (magus level a x3, 1.5x magus level at x4). This damage is of the same type as the spell; if the spell does not deal damage it instead is of the type matching that of the magus’s weapon.
## Spellblade Magics
The Magus may select one of the following bonus talents using their spellblade magics class feature: Elemental Weapon, Elemental Blast, Improved Elemental Blast, Wave Shield, Elemental Shell
## Spellblade Arcana:
Listed below are the spellblade arcana available to the arcane fencer spellblade focus:

- **Dimensional Thrust (Magus 10th)**: The magus may spend 1 point from his ki pool reaction as part of making an attack roll to treat himself as having flanking against a target for the purposes of the attack and any damage that occurs from that attack.
- **Arcane Lunge (Magus 10th)**: The magus may spend 1 point from his ki pool as a reaction to treat all attacks he makes as having a 5 foot longer reach until the start of his next turn. When using this ability all slashing or bludgeoning damage his weapons deal is converted to piercing damage. This reach improves by an additional 5 feet at 15th and 20th level.
- **Arcane Pierce (Magus 15th)**: The magus may spend 1 point from his ki pool as a reaction to treat any DR and Resist a creature possesses as 1 lower for every 4 levels of magus he possesses. These benefits last until the start of his next turn.
