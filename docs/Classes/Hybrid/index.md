Hybrid classes are classes with both access to martial and magic capabilities, usually at a slight reduction in the efficiency in both while gaining the power and flexibility of combining the two. For more information on [[../Martial/index|Martial]] and [[../Magic/index|Magic]] see their individual pages for more information.
