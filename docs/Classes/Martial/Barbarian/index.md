# Class Features

The following are class features of the barbarian. 

## Weapon and Armor Proficiency

A barbarian is proficient with all simple weapons and armor. If this is the character’s first level in a class he gains proficiency in all martial weapons and light martial armor.

## Stamina (Ex)

At 1st level, a barbarian gains access to a pool of <a href="/Combat%20Rules/Combat%20Statistics/#stamina">stamina</a> points that allow him to perform feats of strength and agility. This pool contains a number of stamina points equal to his Endurance modifier plus levels in martial classes (minimum 1). This pool replenishes once per day after a long rest.
## Powerful Strikes (Ex)

If this is the character’s first level in a martial class, the barbarian may gain Power Stance or Reckless Stance as a bonus feat.
## Rage (Ex)

A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting him additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can spend 1 point of stamina to rage for 1 minute. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action.

While in rage, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus to his Attack, MSB, and Damage rolls. In addition, he takes a –2 penalty to Armor Class. In addition at the beginning of each turn the Barbarian gains 2 temporary hit points plus an additional temporary hit point per two levels of barbarian he possesses; these temporary hit points last for 1 round or until the barbarian’s rage ends. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Psyche-, Agility-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration (such as taking a 10 or 20, or casting a spell).

A barbarian can end his rage as a free action and is fatigued after raging for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, his rage immediately ends.

At 3rd level the barbarian may spend an additional stamina when his rage is about to end, to instead allow it to continue for an additional minute. The barbarian may do this once per rage plus an additional time for every 6 levels after 3rd. These continued rounds of rage stack with the original for the purposes of determining how long the barbarian would be fatigued at the end of this rage. Allowing the rage to continue does not refill the barbarian’s fury pool, and must still be refilled as normal.

At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter the barbarian’s bonus to attack and damage increases by an additional 1 while raging. Starting at 15th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his rage.

## Barbaric Vitality (Ex)

At 1st level, a barbarian becomes more sturdy than others treating their Endurance as 2 higher points per level of barbarian he possesses for the purposes of determining when he dies from hit point damage.

In addition the barbarian gains a +1 class bonus to Tenacity and Athletics improving by +1 at 4th level and every 4 thereafter.

## Barbaric Path (Ex)

While a barbarian may not have a graceful approach to problems, a barbarian still grows as a combatant as he gains levels, learning additional tricks and techniques. Starting at 2nd level and every two barbarian levels thereafter, a barbarian gains a barbaric path. Additional Barbaric Paths may be taken using the Extra Talent feat.

For a complete listing of barbaric paths see Table: [[./Barbaric Paths/index|Barbaric Paths]].

## Fury (Ex)

At 3rd level a barbarian learns to channel his rage in new and destructive ways. While raging the barbarian gains a pool of fury equal to his 1+Endurance modifier (minimum 2). This pool empties at the end of a rage and fills each time the barbarian enters a new rage. The barbarian may spend 1 stamina as a move action on his turn to refill his Fury pool without requiring him to enter a new rage.

## Aggression (Ex)

At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter the barbarian gains an aggression allowing him to tap further into the potential of his rage and fury. Unless otherwise noted aggressions can only be used if the barbarian is raging.  At 11th level the barbarian gains an additional aggression. If an Aggression talent calls for a save attack the save attack is made at 1d20 + ½ MPB + Endurance modifier unless specified otherwise. They may add the enhancement bonus of a wielded weapon to this save attack.

For a complete listing of aggressions see Table: [[./Aggressions/index|Aggressions]].

## Barbaric Bond (Ex/Su)

At 5th level the barbarian expands his capabilities in a number of ways. He barbarian chooses one of the following packages gaining its benefits.

For a complete listing of barbaric bonds see Table: [[./Barbaric Bonds/index|Barbaric Bonds]]

## Vigor (Ex)

At 7th level, once per day the barbarian may spend a reaction to empty his current fury pool, gaining a number of temporary hit points equal to twice the number of fury points spent in this way; this ability may be used in response to taking damage, and temporary hit points gained through this ability last until the start of the barbarian’s next turn. At 12th level and every 5 levels thereafter the barbarian may use this ability an additional time per day.

## Savagery (Ex/Su)

At 9th, 13th, and 17th level the barbarian selects a savagery that represents his bloodline, tribe, beliefs, or connection to another power. Unless otherwise specified, savageries do not require the barbarian to be raging to receive their benefits. If a savagery calls for a save attack the save attack is made at 1d20 + ½ MPB + Endurance modifier unless specified otherwise. They may add the enhancement bonus of a wielded weapon to this save attack.

For a complete listing of savageries see Table: [[./Savageries/index|Savageries]]

## Unstoppable (Ex)

At 20th level, the barbarian becomes nearly unkillable. The barbarian gains DR 5/- and energy resistance 1 to acid, cold, electricity, and fire damage; if the barbarian already possesses DR or energy resistance from their race or a barbarian class feature, instead increase it by 1. Finally while raging the barbarian gains regeneration 5, and the barbarian’s rage does not end even if knocked unconscious or dead, though it still only lasts up to its maximum number of rounds and may not be refreshed if unconscious or dead.
