| Arcane Defiance | Su   | Barbarian 7th  | Once per round the barbarian may spend 1 fury to gain 10% spell resistance as a reaction when targeted by a spell. The barbarian must be aware of the caster at the time this ability is used. The barbarian may choose to spend additional fury when using this ability to gain additional 10% spell resistance, though cannot gain more than 50% spell resistance in a single use. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter the barbarian gains 5 more spell resistance per fury spent, and improves the maximum spell resistance of this ability by 5%. This spell resistance lasts until the start of the barbarian's next turn.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Bloody Impale   | Ex   | -              | The barbarian may attempt to punch through a creature’s flesh to damage its vital organs. When the barbarian critically hits he may as a free action spend 1 fury to make a Resilience(End) save attack against the opponent. On a success the target takes 1d4 points of Strength, Endurance, or Agility damage (chosen by the barbarian). At 10th level the barbarian may select an additional ability score to damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Breaker         | Ex   | -              | The barbarian may spend 1 point of fury as part of a melee attack against an object or performing a sunder combat maneuver to add his barbarian level to the damage roll (a failed maneuver still spends this fury). The barbarian may not use this ability if sundering natural weapons or natural armor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Chase           | Ex   | -              | Once per round the barbarian may spend 1 fury as a reaction to move up to his speed. He may only use this ability when a foe within his reach uses an action to move away from him; and his movement must end adjacent (or as close as possible) to the creature that moved. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Clarity         | Ex   | -              | You may spend 1 fury as a free action at the beginning of your turn while raging; until the beginning of your next turn you no longer have a restriction on what actions can be performed during a rage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Flesh Wound     | Su   | -              | The barbarian may spend 1 fury per 2 points of damage he takes to convert an equal amount of that damage to nonlethal damage. He may convert an additional point of damage per fury for every 5 levels of barbarian he possesses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Hurling         | Ex   | -              | As a 4 AP action while raging, the barbarian can spend 1 point of fury lift and hurl an object up to one size category smaller than himself with both hands or two size categories smaller with one hand as an improvised thrown weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. This inflicts 1d6 damage plus an additional 1d6 per size category above tiny This damage is halved if the object is not made of stone, metal, or similar material. Even if using a weapon with this ability the barbarian does not use the statistics of the weapon for this attack (damage dice, crit, keywords, etc..) as its is treated as an improvised thrown weapon regardless; enhancement bonuses to hit and damage may apply as normal.<br><br>The barbarian may spend 2 fury to reduce this to a standard action. |
| Mighty Chop     | Ex   |                | The barbarian may spend 2 fury when making a focused attack. This first attack of this focused attack deals additional damage equal to his levels in barbarian and he increases the critical multiplier of his weapon by 1 for this attack. At 11th level the barbarian may spend 4 fury to instead add twice his barbarian level to this damage roll and increase the crit range and crit multiplier by 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Mighty Swing    | Ex   | Barbarian 7th  | The barbarian may spend 3 fury as a 3 AP action to make a special sunder maneuver against a target. If successful the target’s DR is reduced by half for 1 minute or until the target receives healing equal to or greater than the barbarian’s Endurance modifier. At 15th level if the target does not possess DR the target instead gains vulnerability to a single physical damage type matching the damage type of the weapon used to make this sunder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Raze            | Ex   | Barbarian 11th | The barbarian may spend 3 fury as a 4 AP action; the barbarian causes such destruction around him that all creatures within 30 feet of him take 1d8 damage per two barbarian levels he possesses plus his Endurance modifier. Creatures within this area may make a Physical(Agi) save for half damage (against 1d20 + ½ MPB + Endurance modifier)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Rising Swing    | Ex   | Barbarian 7th  | You make an upwards swing going under the foe’s guard and potentially unbalancing them. The barbarian may spend 2 fury when making a focused attack. The fighter rolls his attack as normal, but the foe must make a sense motive check against this attack roll, if it fails to exceed this attack the foe is treated as if you had successfully used feint on that foe before this attack. In addition feats that modify feint (besides changing the action required to use it) may be applied to this feint attempt (such as Greater feint increasing the duration of the feint effect).                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Savage Accuracy | Ex   | -              | The barbarian may spend 1 point of fury as a reaction to gain a +1 bonus on his next attack roll made before the end of his next turn. This bonus increases by +1 for every 4 levels of barbarian.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Savage Blow     | Ex   | -              | The barbarian may spend 1 point of fury as a reaction to gain a +1 bonus on his next damage roll made before the end of his next turn. This bonus increases by +1 for every 4 levels of barbarian.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Savage Grapple  | Ex   | -              | The barbarian may spend 1 point of fury when making an attack with an unarmed strike or natural weapon (thus a failed attack roll still spends this fury); if the attack is successful the barbarian may attempt to grapple that creature as a free action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Shockwave Sweep | Ex   | -              | The barbarian swings his weapon with such force it causes a shockwave to emanate out from him. The barbarian may spend 2 fury as a 3 AP action to damage all foes within a cone of 10 feet + 5 feet per 2 barbarian levels, dealing the barbarian’s weapon damage plus an additional 1d6 damage per three barbarian levels (with a damage type of the weapon used with this ability). Creatures within this area are subject to a Physical save attack. A failed save attack deals half damage. At 11th level the barbarian may increase the AP and fury cost of this ability by 1 to instead cause damage in a radius burst around the barbarian but at ½ the range.                                                                                                                                  |
| Spell Sunder    | Su   | Barbarian 7th  | The barbarian may spend 5 fury to attempt to destroy an ongoing spell with the sheer power of his rage. The barbarian may make a MSB check against a spell.

To sunder a spell on a creature, the barbarian must succeed at a normal sunder combat maneuver against the creature treating. If successful the barbarian may suppress the effect for 1 round plus an additional round for every 5 the barbarian exceeds the creature’s CMD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Steel Shove     | Ex   | -              | The barbarian may spend 1 fury to make a Shove reposition attempt in place of a melee attack (using the base attack bonus of the replaced attack). If he succeeds the creature takes damage equal to his strength modifier and is subject to a reposition attempt (choosing to move with the creature or not as normal). At 11th level the barbarian may add any enhancement bonuses to his armor’s AC to this combat maneuver attempt and the damage of this ability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
