It does not gain the benefit of any barbaric paths that require actions to activate, even if they are free actions.

| Storm of Souls             | Su   | Vengeful Spirits savagery, Barbarian 17th          | The barbarian learns to temporarily disperse the souls that cling to him, sending their malevolent energies out. By spending 1 stamina as a 4 AP action all foes within 30 feet of the barbarian are subject to a Resilience(Psy) save attack (against 1d20 + ½ your MPB + his Psyche modifier). Successful save attack deals 1d6 points of decay energy damage per two levels of barbarian he possesses and are treated as if the barbarian had successfully demoralized them with an intimidate check. A failed save attack reduces the damage by half. Success by two degrees or more increases the effect of the demoralize by one step (from shaken to frightened, and frightened to panicked or cowering). If the barbarian hits a creature already under the effects of a fear effect he immediately heals for 2 hit points, plus an 2 hit points per degree of success on the save attack; this can trigger for each enemy if multiple enemies hit with this ability.<br><br>The barbarian may spend 2 fury to reduce the AP cost of this action by 1.                                                                                                                                               |

The barbarian’s melee attacks deal additional decay energy damage equal to his Psyche modifier (minimum 1). Creatures who start their turn adjacent to the barbarian while he is raging are subject to an intimidate check from the barbarian as if he attempted to demoralize them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
