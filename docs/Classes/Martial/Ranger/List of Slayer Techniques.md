| Deadeye Shot(Ex)            | \-                              | A ranger can take careful aim with a two-handed bow or trigger keyword weapon for a single deadly shot.<br><br>The ranger gains the Vital Strike feat as a bonus feat even if he would not meet the prerequisites; if the ranger already possesses this feat or later gains it the ranger may instead treat their base attack bonus from their ranger levels as equal to their levels in ranger for the purposes of determining the effects of the feat, except for the attack roll itself.<br><br>When using the vital strike feat to make an attack the ranger may spend 2 additional stamina to convert all damage dealt by the Vital Strike into precision damage.<br><br>In addition when the ranger spends additional AP to further improve the damage of vital strike, the ranger may instead make an extra attack roll as part of this ability before rolling the damage. These extra attack rolls roll against the same AC as the first attack of the vital strike. For each successful attack beyond the first the ranger increases the damage of the vital strike as normal for spending the additional AP but also treats the critical threat range of the weapon as 1 higher for each one; this increase in threat range applies to all attacks of the vital strike, not just this attack or subsequent ones. If one of these additional attacks is a critical hit the damage of the vital strike becomes a critical hit, and for each additional successful crit treat the critical multiplier of the weapon as 1 higher. If this extra attack roll fails the ranger does not receive the increase to damage. |
| Elemental Arrow Nova (Su)   | Elemental Bow slayer technique  | Whenever wielding a weapon under the effects of empowered arrow the ranger may choose to make a single attack as a 3 AP action. If the attack hits, the elemental damage from his Empowered Arrow ability is applied to all creatures within 5 feet + 5 feet per 3 ranger levels of the creature he confirmed the critical on; making a Physical(Agi) save attack against all creatures in the area. A failed save attack deals half damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Elemental Bow (Su)          | Empowered Arrow hunter training | The ranger may choose any elemental affinity talent upon gaining this slayer technique, he is treated as having this talent for the purposes of the elemental damage his empowered arrow may deal. The ranger’s empowered arrow damage improves by 2d4. In addition the ranger may choose to split the damage of his elemental arrow across multiple elements, for example the ranger may choose to deal half nature and half fire damage as part of the same attack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Homing Arrow                | Hunter’s Mark slayer talent     | The ranger learns to guide his attacks unerringly towards his target. For 2 stamina as a 4 AP action the ranger may make a single ranged attack against the target of his Hunter’s Mark. This attack may be made even if the ranger does not have line of sight of his target, and the attack may curve around corners or obstacles, though if the attack cannot find a path without an obstacle the attack fails (such as a target being inside of a structure with no open windows or doors). In addition you ignore all attack penalties for range increments for this single attack, but the attack still cannot exceed the maximum range increment of the weapon.<br><br>If this attack successfully hits the ranger add twice his Focus modifier to the damage of this attack in addition to the normal damage types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Hunter’s Mark               | \-                              | The ranger learns to mark a foe making them more susceptible to attacks. For 2 stamina as a 3 AP action the ranger marks a single creature. Once marked attacks against the creature gain the benefits of ½ the ranger’s Aim bonus as an insight bonus to attack and damage rolls against the target; but attacks from the ranger himself are treated as if the ranger had used the Aim ability, gaining the full bonuses. In addition the ranger gains a bonus to survival checks to track the target of this mark equal to his bonus to attack rolls with aim.<br><br>The ranger may use this ability once per day plus an additional time per day per 8  levels in ranger he possesses.<br><br>This effect lasts 2 hours plus 1 per ranger level, or until the ranger uses this ability again against a different creature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
