# Class Features

The following are class features of the ranger.

## Weapon and Armor Proficiency

A ranger is proficient with all simple weapons and armor. If this is the character’s first level in a class he gains proficiency in all light martial armor. In addition the ranger may gain proficiency in their choice of a single martial bow keyword weapon, martial or exotic trigger keyword weapon, or thrown keyword weapons.

## Stamina (Ex)

At 1st level, a ranger gains access to a pool of <a href="/Combat%20Rules/Combat%20Statistics/#stamina">stamina</a> points that allows her to perform feats of strength and agility. This pool contains a number of stamina points equal to his Endurance modifier plus his levels in martial classes (minimum 1). This pool replenishes once per day after a long rest.

## Ranger’s Precision (Ex)

If this is the character’s first level in a martial class, the ranger gains their choice of Power Stance or Precise Stance as a bonus feat.

## Tracker’s Training (Ex)

At 1st level, the ranger may select any two of the following: perception, ride, survival, stealth, or a knowledge skill; the ranger gains a +1 class bonus in the selected skills improving by an additional 1 at 4th level and levels thereafter.

## Aim (Ex)

At 1st level, the Ranger learns to focus their senses as a 2 AP action gaining a +1 insight bonus on all attack and damage rolls against a single target he can see, and treats their crit range of their weapon as 1 higher (20 becomes 19-20, 19-20 becomes 18-20). These bonuses only apply on ranged weapon attacks against this target, and last until the beginning of their next turn.

At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter the ranger increases the insight bonus on attack and damage rolls with aim by an additional 1.

At 10th level the ranger may use this ability as a reaction.

At 15th level the ranger increases the critical multiplier of their weapon by 1 against the target.

## Animal Companion (Ex)

At 1st level, the Ranger forms a bond with an animal companion. It gains a companion as described on the companion page treating your levels in ranger as SPB to determine the progression of this companion (and stacks with SPB gained from other sources). Abilities of the companion that would cost spell points instead cost an equal amount of the ranger’s stamina.

The animal companion gained this way must select the Avian, Quadruped, Serpentine, or Arachnid base form. It gains the Animal type as its companion type. The companion gains these types and talents even if the ranger does not meet the prerequisites. In addition the companion gains the Battle Companion talent as its 1st level bonus talent.

If a ranger releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 16 uninterrupted hours usually in prayer or performing a ritual in the environment where the new companion typically lives.

While companions can take many forms a ranger’s animal companion should usually have a form similar to that of a non-magical animal (wolf, tiger, hawk, horse, etc..) though the GM may allow for other creatures. If the setting would allow the GM may allow a Ranger to take the Aquatic companion type but must treat it as an Aquatic Animal (with the reduced Intelligence); in addition if Aquatic Companion is chose add Aquatic Being to the list of Animal Focus the ranger may select.

## Hunter Training (Ex)

At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter the ranger gains a hunter training that grants additional prowess in and out of combat for hunting, tracking, and slaying foes. Additional Hunter Trainings may be taken using the Extra Talent feat

For a complete listing of training see [[./List of Hunter Trainings|List of Hunter Trainings]]

## Animal Focus (Ex)

At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter the hunter may choose one of the following companion talents and add them to their animal companion even if the ranger does not meet any prerequisites except for any SPB requirements; if a talent may be taken more than once the ranger may select it multiple times but is still subject to any limitation to taking it an additional time (such as SPB requirements):

- Altered Size, Armored Companion, Battle Arsenal, Bloodhound, Camouflaged Companion, Empowered Companion, Improved Limbs, Martial Companion, Mount, Versatile Companion, Poisonous Strikes, Work Animal

At 6th level the ranger adds the following talents to the list of talents their companion may select:

- Quick Companion, Superior Senses, Variable Size(Requires Altered Size).

At 12th level the ranger may choose one of the following in place of the other talents:

- Your companion gains the elemental creature companion talent as a bonus talent of any element of your choice.
- Your companion gains the draconic companion talent as a bonus talent of any element of your choice.
- Your companion gains the Alpha Predator Presence talent as a bonus talent.

## Hawkeye (Ex)

At 5th level the ranger learns to further their prowess with ranged weapons increasing the range increment of any thrown, crossbow, bow, or firearm keyword weapons by 5ft. At 10th level and every 5 thereafter the ranger gains an additional 5ft bonus to their range increment with these weapons.

## Hunter’s Command (Ex)

At 7th level the ranger learns to push their companion to even greater action allowing for better tactical cooperation. Each round the hunter may choose to perform one of the following actions, though each action may require a different type of action or scenario to utilize the hunter may still only perform one per round.

- Outflank: When your animal companion has flanking against a creature you are attacking, you may as a reaction treat your attacks until the beginning of your next turn as also having flanking against that creature even if you normally would not. If your animal companion loses flanking against the target this bonus immediately ends.
- Reposition: Once per round as a 1 AP action you may command your animal companion causing it to move up to its speed. Your animal companion must be able to hear you and capable of moving for you to use this ability. You may use this ability an additional time per round by spending 1 stamina. This action is a bonus action for the animal companion and does not spend any additional actions for the companion.
- Strike: Once per round as a 2 AP action you may command your animal companion to make a single attack against a creature within range of it. You may direct the animal companion to attack a specific creature you can see though the creature must be within range of the companion to attack, otherwise it will attempt to make an attack against a random hostile  creature adjacent to it. Your animal companion must be able to hear you for you to use this ability. You may spend 1 stamina to use this ability an additional time per round. This action is a bonus action for the animal companion and does not spend any additional actions for the companion.
- Cover: When you would perform an action that would provoke an attack of opportunity while your animal companion is adjacent to you, you may once per round as a reaction direct your companion to interfere causing any attack of opportunity taken against that action to have a 50% chance to miss, but attacks that miss due to this miss chance instead target the animal companion. This benefit is only active for a single triggering action as well as only active while the animal companion remains adjacent to you. You may use this ability an additional time per round by spending 1 stamina. This action is a bonus action for the animal companion and does not spend any additional actions for the companion.
- Frightening Howl: You may spend 1 stamina to command your companion as a 3 AP action to make a frightening howl, roar, or other aggressive or unnerving action. Roll a Knowledge(Nature) check, enemies within 30 feet of your animal companion who can hear it are subject to a demoralize attempt using your Knowledge(Nature) check as the intimidate check. This action is a bonus action for the animal companion and does not spend any additional actions for the companion.

## Slayer Techniques (Ex)

At 11th, the ranger becomes more specialized as a hunter and refines their techniques becoming more than a hunter, but a slayer due to their newfound prowess. The ranger gains an additional slayer technique at 13th level and every 2 levels thereafter. If a slayer technique calls for a save attack it is made at 1d20+ ½ MPB + the ranger’s Focus modifier. The ranger may add the enhancement bonus of a wielded weapon to this save attack.

For a complete listing of training see [[./List of Slayer Techniques|List of Slayer Techniques]]

## Greater Focus (Ex)

At 13th, the ranger learns to put greater focus into himself or his companion choosing one of the following:

- Deadly Aim: The ranger’s insight bonus to attack rolls from Aim improves by an additional 1 plus 1 per 5 ranger levels he possesses.
- Greater Companion: The ranger’s level is treated as 1 higher for the purposes of determining the ranger’s SPB for their animal companion. This bonus improves by an additional 1 per 5  levels the ranger possesses.

## Legend Hunter (Su)

At 17th, the ranger has set their sights upon creatures of legend and greater beings as the target of their hunts. As such the ranger must bring their power to new heights to take on such legends. The ranger choses one of the following:

- Legendary Companion: Your companion gains the following:
    - Your companion gains variable size and altered size as a bonus companion talents and altered size may allow a companion to become colossal rather than gargantuan. If you already possess these talents or would gain them later you instead reduce the AP cost of variable size by 1 for each of these talents (minimum 1 AP).
    - Your companion gains a second companion type in addition to the animal companion type gaining all the benefits and detriments of this new type.
- The ranger may target a number of creatures up to his Focus modifier with his aim ability as part of a single use of aim each turn and his Aim ability now lasts until the end of his next turn. In addition the ranger may treat any creature he attacks targeted by his aim ability as having any elemental resistance, natural armor,  DR a creature possesses as 1 lower for every 10 ranger levels he possesses.

## Master of the Hunt (Ex)

At 20th, the ranger has become the master of the hunt, a legend among legends treating all as his prey. The ranger can always move at full speed while using survival to follow tracks without penalty, and gains a +5 bonus to survival checks made to track if he already possesses the swift tracker hunter training. In addition the ranger no longer needs to spend an action to use his aim ability effectively treating all creatures he can see as targeted by it. Finally the ranger’s animal companion gains the benefits of flanking against any creature affected by the ranger’s aim ability.
