This Battle Mastery is treated as Battle Focus for the purposes of feats and abilities that require Battle Focus and lasts the same duration as Battle Focus. The Fighter Treats his fighter levels as 10 higher for the purposes of determining the power of his fighter talents with battle focus as a prerequisites. In addition the fighter adds half his MPB to all damage rolls he makes while in Battle Mastery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

In addition, when in Battle Focus the fighter may spend 1 stamina as a reaction to grant his weapon a +1 enhancement bonus while he maintains Battle Focus; this bonus may stack with any enhancement bonus currently on the weapon (though not with itself). This Enhancement bonus increases by 1 per 3 fighter levels he possesses.<br><br>When the fighter uses this ability, the total enhancement bonus of the enhancement bonus of the weapon cannot exceed +5; but attacks with the weapon ignores 1 point of DR a creature possesses for every +1 the weapon would have gone above +5. |
