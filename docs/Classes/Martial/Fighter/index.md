# Class Features

The following are class features of the fighter.

## Weapon and Armor Proficiency

A fighter is proficient with all simple weapons and armor. If this is the character’s first level in a class he gains proficiency in all martial weapons and armor.

## Stamina (Ex)

At 1st level, a fighter gains access to a pool of <a href="/Combat%20Rules/Combat%20Statistics/#stamina">stamina</a> points that allow him to perform feats of strength and agility. This pool contains a number of stamina points equal to his Endurance modifier plus his levels in martial classes (minimum 1). This pool replenishes once per day after a long rest.

## Combat Stance (Ex)

If this is the character’s first level in a martial class, the fighter gains a bonus Stance feat that he qualifies for.
## Martial Training (Ex)

At 1st, 2nd, and at every even level thereafter, a fighter gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as Combat Feats or Martial feats.

## Fighter’s Flexibility (Ex)

At 2nd level, a fighter may spend 1 stamina as a 2 AP action to gain the benefit of a single martial or combat feat he qualifies for but does not possess for 1 minute. Additional uses of this ability replaces the feat with a different choice; while also refreshing the duration of the ability to the full minute again. If a feat has a use limitation, any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat’s limit, even if that feat is lost and regained at a later point in the same day.

At 8th level, the fighter may use this ability to gain the benefit of feats at the same time instead of one; the fighter may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat. At 12th level the AP cost of this ability is reduced by 1. At 15th level this improves to three feats. At 20th level this improves to four feats.
## Fighter Talent (Ex)

As a fighter gains experience, he learns to further hone his combat ability. Starting at 3rd level, and every two levels thereafter the fighter gains a fighter talent. Additional Fighter Talents may be taken using the Extra Talent feat.

For a complete listing of fighter talents see [[./List of Fighter Talents|List of Fighter Talents]]

## Armor Focus (Ex)

At 3rd level, a fighter learns to focus into either light or heavy armor to further draw upon the strengths and minimize the weaknesses of each. A fighter selects one of the following:

| Name              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Armored Fortress  | A fighter may treat his AC bonus from his armor 1 higher for the purposes of how much damage he may redirect to his armor from an attack. In addition he may treat up to 1 point of precision damage as normal damage for the purpose of determining what damage his armor may redirect. Every four levels after 3rd increases these bonuses by an additional 1. When selecting this ability, the fighter chooses light or heavy armor for which this ability applies to.                                                                         |
| Heavy Armor Focus | A fighter may treat his AC bonus from his armor 1 higher for the purposes of how much damage he may redirect to his armor from an attack. In addition he may treat up to 1 point of precision damage as normal damage for the purpose of determining what damage his armor may redirect. Every four levels after 3rd increases these bonuses by an additional 1. When selecting this ability, the fighter chooses light or heavy armor for which this ability applies to.                                                                         |
| Light Armor Focus | Whenever he is wearing light armor, he may apply his half his armor’s armor bonus (including enhancement bonuses) to his touch AC, stacking with the nimble property if the armor possesses it. At 10th level the fighter may apply his full armor bonus to his touch AC; also stacking with the bonus from nimble.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Unarmored Focus   | When the fighter is unarmored and unencumbered the fighter gains a +1 shield bonus to AC. Every four levels after 3rd increases these bonuses by an additional 1. In addition, once per day when the fighter uses the Roll With It stamina ability to reroll an AC roll he may treat a failure by less than one degree on the reroll as a successful AC roll; or treat failure by two degrees or less as a failure by one degree or less. The fighter may use this ability an additional time per day at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter. |


## Weapon Training (Ex)

Starting at 5th level, a fighter selects one of the following keywords: Blade, Dueling, Hammer, Spear, Axe, Bow, Flails, Trigger, Polearm, Monastic, Shield, or Sling.

Whenever he attacks with a weapon with this keyword, he gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls. Every four levels after 5th these bonuses increase by +1 each. This bonus also applies to the fighter’s saves when defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against his weapons from this group.

At 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter the fighter may select an additional keyword to apply these bonuses to. Bonuses granted from multiple keywords on the same weapon do not stack.

## Signature Feat (Ex)

At 7th level, a fighter may select a single feat he possesses, he may treat his base attack bonus a 2 higher for the purposes of any effects of that feat that are dependent on base attack bonus. This does not increase the Fighter’s base attack bonus for the purposes of determining his bonus to attack rolls when using the chosen feat. At 11th level and every 4 levels thereafter the fighter increases this bonus by an additional +1 as well as may select an additional feat. Each time the fighter selects a new feat he may also choose a different feat in place of a feat he’s previously selected.

## Armor Mastery (Ex)

At 19th level, a fighter gains damage reduction 5/— whenever he is wearing armor that of a type matching his armor focus class feature (light, heavy, or unarmored). If the fighter chooses armored fortress this feature works with any type of armor, light or heavy. This DR stacks with other untyped DR he attains from other sources. In addition the fighter halves all strength rating penalties from armor.

## Weapon Mastery (Ex)

At 20th level, a fighter chooses one weapon, such as the longsword, greataxe, or longbow. Any attacks damage as if they were one size category larger, have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (×2 becomes ×3, for example). In addition the crit threat range of the weapon improves by 1. Finally, the bonuses granted by his armor focus and weapon training increase by 2 each.
