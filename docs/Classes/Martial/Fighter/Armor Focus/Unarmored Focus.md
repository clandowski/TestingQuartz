description: When the fighter is unarmored and unencumbered the fighter gains a +1 shield bonus to AC. Every four levels after 3rd increases these bonuses by an additional 1. In addition, once per day when the fighter uses the Roll With It stamina ability to reroll an AC roll he may treat a failure by less than one degree on the reroll as a successful AC roll; or treat failure by two degrees or less as a failure by one degree or less. The fighter may use this ability an additional time per day at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.
