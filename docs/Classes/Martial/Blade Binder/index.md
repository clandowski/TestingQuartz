# Class Features

The following are class features of the blade binder.

## Weapon and Armor Proficiency

A blade binder is proficient with all simple weapons and armor. If this is the character’s first level in a class he gains proficiency in all martial weapons and armor.

## Stamina (Ex)

At 1st level, a blade binder gains access to a pool of <a href="/Combat%20Rules/Combat%20Statistics/#stamina">stamina</a> points that allow him to perform feats of strength and agility. This pool contains a number of stamina points equal to his Endurance modifier plus his levels in martial classes (minimum 1). This pool replenishes once per day after a long rest.

## Combat Stance (Ex)

If this is the character’s first level in a martial class, the blade binder gains his choice of Power Stance, Whirlwind Stance, or Skirmisher Stance as a bonus feat.

## Summon Equipment (Su)

At 1st level, the blade binder learns to summon weapons and armor through the combination of his own power and the powers of creation itself. This ability requires a 3 AP action and 1 stamina, summoning the weapon directly into the hands of the blade binder; or on the blade binder if armor. The summoned weapon or armor must be one the blade binder is proficient with and appropriately sized for him; the shape, size, and type is chosen at the time of summoning. Once summoned, the equipment lasts indefinitely or until the blade leaves his possession for longer than 1 round. Weapons and armor summoned with this ability are summoned with a +1 enhancement bonus.

You may only have 2 weapons plus an additional 1 weapon per 6 blade binder levels you possess summoned at one time. The blade binder may summon a suit of armor in place of one of these weapons, but may only have one set of armor summoned at one time, replacing the existing one each time he summons a new one.

When summoning a combination or double weapon the blade binder must pay 2 stamina to summon it, but doing applies any blade improvements or additional bonuses to both weapons of the weapon without requiring the blade binder to pay a second time. Double weapons and combination weapons count as 2 weapons for the purposes of how many weapons the blade binder currently has summoned. At 2nd level a blade binder may summon two weapons with a single use of summon weapon by increasing the stamina cost by 1.

Armor summoned by the blade binder has a health pool of 15 hit points per blade binder level instead of its usual hit point pool. This health pool is shared across all his summoned armor; and once depleted he may no longer summon armor for the remainder of the day. This armor health pool cannot be repaired by any magic or mundane means except for blade binder abilities that allow him to restore this armor health pool. In addition, despite the type of armor his armor’s hardness is always 5 + 1 per 4 blade binder levels. If the blade binder has levels in another class besides blade binder he may count his levels in class besides blade binder classes as ½ blade binder levels for determining the hardness of this armor and the size of his armor health pool.

At 3rd level, upon gaining a Ki Pool the Blade Binder may spend Ki instead of stamina when using this ability. In addition at 3rd level, the blade binder may spend 1 additional ki point to allow his summoned equipment to gain an additional +1 enhancement bonus (maximum +5) for every 3 MPB he possesses after 1st,  to a maximum of +5; this additional ki must be spent at the time of summoning each piece of equipment.

## Binder Talent (Su)

At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter a binder gains the benefits of a binder talent. If a binder talent calls for a save attack the save attack is made at 1d20 + ½ MPB + Psyche modifier unless specified otherwise. They may add the enhancement bonus of a wielded weapon to this save attack. Additional Binder Talents may be taken using the Extra Talent feat.

For a complete listing of binder talents, see [[./Binder Talents/index|Binder Talents]]

## Bind Enhancement (Su)

At 2nd level, the blade binder learns to channel his energies into an existing piece of equipment he is currently wielding. By spending the same cost to summon a weapon or armor he may cause a single piece of equipment to attain any enhancement bonus his summon weapon ability would allow. Due to the strengthening nature of this ability, the blade binder may enhance items that normally aren’t meant to be weapons, allowing him to treat himself as proficient with a improvised weapon he has enhanced; the improvised weapon is still treated as improvised for the purposes of feats and abilities that interact with improvised weapons. As part of using this ability the blade binder may choose to allow the weapon or armor to have equipment improvements applied to it; subject to the same restrictions of equipment improvements as normal. This enhancement lasts until the blade binder rests to regain stamina or when the weapon leaves his possession for more than 1 round. Weapons enhanced this way are otherwise treated as summoned weapons while they are enhanced for the purposes of interacting with other blade binder abilities.

## Ki Pool (Su)

At 3rd level, a blade binder gains access to a pool of internal energies called ki, which allow him to perform supernatural feats that go beyond the limits of his physical body. This pool contains a number of ki points equal 1 + his Psyche modifier (minimum 2) and refreshes once per day when the blade binder regains his stamina. A blade binder may spend 1 point of stamina as a free action on his turn to regain 2 points of his ki pool.

As long as the blade binder has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he gains an enhancement bonus on athletics checks to jump equal to his class level, and his unarmed strikes and natural attacks are treated as magic weapons. At 8th level, his unarmed strikes and natural attacks are treated as silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

In addition at 3rd level a blade binder expands his repertoire of his Ki Pool allowing him to spend his ki points in additional ways:

- Ki Reflexes: Spend a ki point in place of a reaction.
- Ki Dodge: Once per round, spend a ki point as a reaction to gain a +4 dodge bonus to AC for 1 round.
- Ki Leap: Once per round, spend a ki point as a reaction to gain a +20 enhancement bonus to athletics checks made to jump for 1 round, and to be considered as having a running start when making such a check.

If a blade binder gains a ki pool from another source, he does not combine the pools for the purposes of determining capacity, nor does he gain an additional ki pool, but may spend points from his ki pool to pay for abilities from either source that require ki points. If each pool requires different ability scores (such as Psyche and Focus) the blade binder may use the higher of the two ability scores when determining the capacity of his ki pool. The blade binder may add together his levels in all classes that grant a ki pool to determine the abilities of his ki pool class feature.

## Equipment Improvements (Su)

At 3rd level, the blade binder gains 2 blade and 2 Armor improvements, allowing him to further customize his summoned equipment. When spending additional ki point to further increase the enhancement bonus of the summoned equipment may choose to apply a blade or armor improvement at the time of summoning.

Summoned Weapons may only have blade improvements applied to them, while Summoned Armor may only have Armor improvement applied to them. Each summoned equipment may have different improvements. A blade binder may only have a maximum of 1 equipment improvement plus an additional equipment improvement for every 4 levels of blade binder you possess (to a maximum of 6 blade improvements) applied to a single summoned weapon or armor.

A summoned weapon or armor with an equipment improvement treats each improvement as a +1 bonus worth of magic weapon or armor special ability (+2 or more if an improvement counts as more than one improvement). If the equipment possesses any magic weapon or armor special abilities from enhancement seals applied to the equipment, in addition to the improvements applied to the weapon, any special abilities from the seal beyond +5 are suppressed until the total magic special abilities plus the improvements are equal to or lower than +5.

At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter the blade binder gains an additional blade improvement and armor improvement. For every 8 levels after 3rd the blade binder gains a bonus blade and armor improvement in addition to the one he normally gains at that level. If a blade improvement calls for a save attack the save attack is made at 1d20 + ½ MPB + Psyche modifier. They may add the enhancement bonus of a wielded equipment to this save attack.

For a complete listing of blade and armor improvements, see [[./Armor Improvements/index|Armor Improvements]] and [[./Blade Improvements/index|Blade Improvements]]

## Binder Specialization (Su)

At 3rd level, the blade binder gains access to a specialization that furthers his capabilities, and in some cases enhances more of his energy sources and material focus. At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter the blade binder gains an additional binder specialization.

For a complete listing of binder specializations, see [[./Binder Specializations/index|Binder Specializations]]

## Stable Binding  (Su)

At 5th level, the blade binder may choose when summoning a weapon to make it a stable weapon capable of existing away from him longer than normal. Weapons summoned by the blade binder now last 1 minute per blade binder level after leaving his possession. Creatures can still detect the conjured, impermanent nature of the weaponry with a DC 10 Appraise or Profession(Blacksmith) check. The blade binder may spend an additional ki point when summoning this equipment to summon it directly within another creature’s possession within 15 feet + 5 feet per 4 blade binder levels.

The blade binder may choose to spend an additional ki point when summoning a weapon to allow the weapon to persist for 1 hour per blade binder level, but when summoned in this way the weapon cannot have any blade improvements applied to it. At 11th weapons summoned in this way may apply a single blade improvement to these weapons. For every 6 levels thereafter the weapon may have one additional blade improvement up to the maximum the blade binder is normally allowed to apply to a single weapon.

## Binder’s Resilience (Ex)

At 9th level, the blade binder becomes more attuned to his summoned equipment, making it difficult to harm them or separate him from them. The binder gains a +3 competence bonus against sunder attempts against his summoned weapons and armor, as well as a +3 competence bonus against disarm attempts against his summoned weapons. At 13th level and every 4 levels thereafter the blade binder improves these competence bonuses by 1.

## Binder’s Mark

At 13th level, the binder learns to leave a trace of his power on his foes. When the blade binder succeeds on a attack roll against a foe using a summoned weapon he may spend a Ki point as a reaction action to make a Resilience(Psy) save attack against the foe he struck (1d20+ ½ MPB + Psyche modifier) the blade binder may add his summon weapon’s enhancement bonus to this save attack. If successful the target gains 2 marks, plus an additional mark per degree of success. If he fails by less than one degree he applies one mark to the target.

As a 3 AP action the blade binder may cause these marks to erupt, forcing weapons to be summoned from within the target, damaging them. When causing the marks to erupt the creature takes 1d10 + Psyche modifier damage per every mark on the target. All marks are removed from the target once they have erupted. A creature must be within 30 feet + 5 feet per 3 Blade Binder levels to erupt marks. Marks on the target last 10 minutes per Blade Binder level.

## Master Binder (Su)

At 15th level, the blade binder’s weapons and armor become equipment of legend. The blade binder may spend 1 additional Ki point as part of summoning his weapons to cause them to ignore a number of points of DR or Hardness equal to 1 + 1 per 5 blade binder levels.

He may also spend 1 additional Ki point as part of summoning his armor to cause all armor he summons to provide him with DR 1/- improving by 1 per 5 blade binder levels; this DR stacks with other sources of DR the blade binder might possess.

## Reality Sphere (Su)

At 20th level, the binder’s source of power for his bound equipment grows to such power it becomes its own plane of existence. This plane of existence is a looping plane (causing creatures to loop around upon reaching the edges) of about 1 mile wide. The view and theme of the inside is the choice of the blade binder, but usually reflects his source of power and his specializations. Time here flows normally and is always hospitable for the blade binder.

The blade binder may transport himself here by spending 1 stamina as a full-round action which provokes attacks of opportunity. While in this area he may meditate for 1 hour. Upon finishing his meditation he becomes more aligned with his source of power allowing the blade binder to treat his MPB as 4 higher for the purposes of determining the power of any of his blade binder class features, as well as an additional blade and armor improvement. In addition, while in this sphere the blade binder reduces the cost of all his abilities that cost Ki points by 1 (minimum 0). This bonus lasts until the blade binder rests and regains stamina. The blade binder may spend a full-round action to return from his sphere, which always returns him to the point he entered his sphere from; this does not cost him a stamina to leave his sphere.

The blade binder may bring 1 adjacent creature along to this plane as part of the same full-round action; but doing so requires a Mental save attack roll (1d20 + ½ blade binder level + Psyche modifier) They may add the enhancement bonus of a wielded weapon to this save attack. On a success the creature is brought to this sphere with him. The creature only remains within this sphere for 1 round per blade binder level, and it may attempt a new Mental save against the original save attack each round as a move action to attempt to force itself out of this sphere.
