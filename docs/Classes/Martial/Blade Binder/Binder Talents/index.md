Then Blade binder may summon up to 10 pieces of ammunition per 2 blade binder levels with a single use of his summon equipment ability. The blade binder may choose to summon this ammunition as part of summoning another weapon; and may choose to summon the weapon already loaded; otherwise the blade binder may summon ammunition separately for use in other weaponry. In addition the Blade Binder may choose to summon this ammunition as part of using Bind Enhancement on a weapon.<br><br>Ammunition bound this way gains the usual enhancement bonuses and may have blade improvements applied to them, if valid for a ranged weapon, but are subject to the same restrictions of enhanced ammunition with an enhanced weapon. This ammunition is unrecoverable and is immediately destroyed when fired; or otherwise dissipates after leaving the blade binder’s possession for more than 1 round. |

| Condensed Armor Strike              | Condensed Elemental Armor                    | The blade binder may cause his condensed elemental armor to strike at all creatures around him for 1 stamina as a standard action, causing blades to form and strike outwards.

On a success creatures within take 3d6 physical and 3d6 elemental damage. A failed Physical(Agi) attack deals half damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
