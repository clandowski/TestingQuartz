description: The blade binder may spend additional AP when using the Offensive Summon ability to make a focused attack with additional attacks. When using this ability the binder summons as many weapons up to the maximum he may make as part of the attack, but only pays the material cost of the summoning for the first weapon summoned this way. Additional weapons summoned after the first immediately disappear after the attack resolves.
