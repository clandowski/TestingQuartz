description: The binder learns to focus his energies, causing his weapon to become both an object of the physical and of pure elemental energy. The binder learns to summon a special scabbard for his summoned weapon. The blade binder may only have one of these special scabbards summoned at one time, and this scabbard counts against his summoned weapon limit.  The binder may spend 2 ki points as part of sheathing a summoned melee weapon within this special scabbard; once within the scabbard the weapon must remain within it for 8 hours before it is drawn again, if drawn early the weapon remains unchanged and the blade binder must pay 2 Ki points to restart the process. If the weapon remains within the scabbard for 8 hours it becomes a condensed elemental blade.  When a condensed elemental blade is first drawn from its scabbard it releases a large wave of energy as if the blade binder had used the elemental wave ability from his elemental manifestation specialization; the binder may spend a Ki point to improve the elemental wave’s damage as normal. Once drawn the condensed elemental blade lasts for 1 minute per blade binder level before the energies dissipate and the weapon returns to a normal summoned weapon.  The condensed elemental blade when drawn takes on an appearance of a solid weapon whose edges wave and crackle with elemental energies making it seem both solid and immaterial at once.  While in this form the blade binder may freely reshape this weapon into a different weapon he is proficient with, and may add or remove weapon special features (such as reach, brace, and blocking) despite the weapons current form. The condensed elemental blade may only add or remove a total number of weapon features on this condensed blade equal to 1 + 1 per 5 blade binder levels.  In addition while in this form the elemental blade deals damage as if affected by the Elemental Shroud ability, but also improves the damage from d6s to d8s; as well as dealing an additional number of points of damage equal to his blade binder level.  All damage dealt by the weapon in this form may be counted as the weapon’s normal damage type and the element’s associated damage type, whichever is more beneficial.
