description: You may summon your equipment in a way that turns them into a dangerous projectile. When using your summon weapon ability you may make a ranged attack roll against a foe within 30 feet, but using the blade binder’s Psyche modifier in place of dexterity for the attack. The foe takes damage as if he had thrown the weapon, but uses his Psyche modifier in place of his Strength for determining damage. For the purposes of interaction with feats and abilities the blade binder may treat this as the focused attack action; though he may not spend more AP to make additional attacks. The blade binder may not use this with abilities that reduce the action cost of summon weapon below a 3 AP action. The summoned weapon lasts the normal duration before disappearing after using this ability.
