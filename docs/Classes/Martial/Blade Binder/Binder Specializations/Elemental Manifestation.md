description: "Upon selecting this specialization the blade binder selects a single element from Air, Void, Fire, Cold, Nature, Decay, Water, or Earth.  The blade binder learns to manifest his chosen element from his elemental shape ability in two different ways. The damage type of this element matches the Associated Damage listed for that element’s affinity.<br><br>Elemental Shroud: The blade binder can spend a Ki point as a 1 AP action to empower his currently summoned weapon to become shrouded in elemental power, dealing an additional 1d6 damage of his chosen element, improving by an additional 1d6 at 5th level and every 5 thereafter; this effect lasts a number of rounds equal to the blade binder’s Psyche modifier.<br><br>Elemental Wave: The blade binder learns to summon his element into an wave of elemental energy. The blade binder may spend 1 Ki point as a 4 AP action to make a Physical(Agi) save attack against all creatures within a line, cone, or burst. A successful save attack deals 1d6 damage per 4 MPB, while a failed save attack deals half damage. At 5th level a blade binder can spend 1 additional Ki point when using this ability to improve the damage to 1d6 per 2 MPB. The blade binder may add the enhancement bonus of their summoned weapon to this save attack."
