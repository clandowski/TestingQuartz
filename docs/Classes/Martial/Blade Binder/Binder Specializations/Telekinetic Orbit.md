description: The blade binder gains telekinetic aura with the telekinetic orbit talent as a natural spell using his class level as his BCB, his MPB as his SPB, and his Psyche as his CAM. The blade binder may cast this as a reaction on his turn, and may spend stamina in place of spell points when using this. Unlike normal, the blade binder may choose to wield weapons within his orbit, but only as long as the items remain within his square; using his statistics as normal for making attack and damage rolls with such weapons. At 3rd level the blade binder may spend ki in place of stamina when using this ability. The blade binder may only use this orbit  with his summoned weapons and may summon his weapons directly into his orbit. At 5th level this natural spell gains the greater orbit talent and treats his reach as 5 feet longer for weapons wielded in his orbit.
special: Shields in orbit do not provide their shield bonus to AC while in orbit and must be wielded directly by the blade binder to grant this benefit.
