description: The blade binder learns to create his armor out of the same condensed elemental energies, using it to create a more flexible form of armor that both protects and helps push his abilities even further. The blade binder may spend 2 ki points to summon a new set of armor of a type he is proficient in, or transform his existing armor into the condensed elemental form. While wearing the condensed elemental armor the blade binder gains an enhancement bonus to his Strength and Agility equal to 1 + the enhancement bonus of his summoned armor, as well as a +10 enhancement bonus to his speed plus an additional 5 per +1 enhancement bonus of his armor. In addition the blade binder gains Resist equal to the armor’s enhancement bonus against his chosen element.  The armor lasts 1 round per blade binder level before the armor dissipates turning into normal armor of its summoned type. The blade binder must wait 8 hours before using this ability again. The binder may not use this ability while fatigued.
