description: The blade binder’s power begins to take on a mind of its own, gaining minor sentience. The blade binder gains a companion as described on the companion page treating his levels in blade binder as spell prowess bonus to determine the progression of this companion (and stacks with spell prowess bonus gained from other sources).  The companion gained this way must select the avian, quadruped, serpentine, or biped base form. It gains the celestial, construct, demonic, or void type as it’s companion type. The companion gains these types and talents even if the blade binder does not meet the prerequisites.  When the blade binder summons a piece of equipment he may choose to spend an additional ki point to summon this companion wielding the chosen piece of equipment. The companion is automatically proficient with the piece of equipment and may wield the weapon or wear the armor without issue. If the creature has a second limb capable of wielding weapons the blade binder may summon two weapons onto the weapon as normal. While wielding the binder’s summoned weapon the equipment does not disappear from not being wielded by the blade binder.  The summoned companion lasts until the blade binder rests to regain stamina. Once slain the creature may not be re-summoned for the remainder of the day until he rests unless the blade binder spends 1 stamina to summon it again, but with only half its total hit points. The blade binder’s companion disappears after 1 round if it goes beyond 30 feet + 5 feet per 2 blade binder levels from the blade binder. While within range of the blade binder the blade binder may telepathically give commands to his blade spirit and direct it as necessary without additional actions required.
