description: The blade binder may now create an additional implement with a new affinity talent and spell that he has not already selected with Implement Binder. When summoning an implement he may now choose which of these implements he is summoning; and may have up to two implements summoned at once now, but each must have a different affinity talent and spell applied. At 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter the blade binder gains a new implement with a new affinity talent and spell; but is still limited to only two implements at a time.
