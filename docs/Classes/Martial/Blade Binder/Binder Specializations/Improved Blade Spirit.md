description: The blade binder’s blade spirit may now remain up to 100 feet + 10 feet per blade binder level from the blade binder before being at risk of disappearing.  In addition, the blade binder learns how to assume direct control of his  blade spirit as a 4 AP action. While in direct control the companion gains a copy of any combat or martial feats the blade binder may possess for the duration of the control. While assuming direct control the blade binder’s primary body may not take actions and is flat-footed, but is otherwise aware of nearby dangers; during this time the binder controls and directs the blade spirit on the blade spirit’s turn. The blade binder may choose to end the direct control as a free action on his turn. Once the control ends the spirit returns to normal and begins taking its own actions again.  At 10th level the blade spirit gains access to a single combat or martial feat the blade binder possesses plus an additional feat per 4 blade binder levels after 10th up to a maximum equal to the blade binder’s psyche modifier.
