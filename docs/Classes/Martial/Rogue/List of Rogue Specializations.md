| Acrobatic Stunt (Ex) | \-                                              | When flanked by at least two opponents, a rogue with this talent can, by spending 1 stamina as a reaction when any of the threatening opponents attacks her, attempting an Acrobatics check against the AC of the attacking creature; treating their AC as 2 higher per threatening creature beyond the second. If successful, the rogue may move 5 feet plus an additional 5 feet per degree of success of this Acrobatics check. If the rogue gains a +2 dodge bonus to their AC against the triggering attack per 5 feet moved as part of this check. Failing by one degree or more causes the rogue to fall prone in her original position and the attack resolves as normal (the opponent gaining the usual benefits for attacking a prone target).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Defensive Roll (Ex)  | \-                                              | The rogue can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. The rogue may spend 1 stamina when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the rogue can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this ability, the rogue must attempt a Physical(Agi) saving throw against a DC of 10 + the amount of hit points the attack would have reduced you below 0. If the save succeeds, she takes only half damage from the attack; if it fails, she takes damage as normal. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll, and if she is Flat-Footed she can’t use this ability. The rogue’s evasion ability does not apply to this ability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Fan of Knives (Ex)   | \-                                              | The rogue may spend 1 stamina as a 4 AP action to make a ranged attack with a thrown keyword weapon against each creature within the first range increment of the thrown weapon, drawing the weapons as part of this action. The rogue may throw any number of weapons with this ability but may not target the same creature twice with this use. The rogue may use the same thrown weapon if he has a way to retrieve the weapon between each throw (such as the Ricochet Throw feat). For every 10 levels the rogue possesses, the rogue may target creatures within an additional range increment, this cannot exceed the maximum range increments of the thrown weapon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Feint Strike (Ex)    | \-                                              | Once per round whenever you succeed at a feint against a creature you may make a single attack against them with a weapon you’re wielding as an attack of opportunity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Leaping Attack (Ex)  | Aerialist specialization, Rogue 13th            | The rogue may spend 1 stamina as a 4 AP action to make a leaping attack at a creature. The rogue makes an Athletics check against a single creature’s Physical(Str) save; treating this as a maneuver for the purposes of bonuses or penalties to their save. If successful the rogue may make a single attack and treat the attack as if she had used a charge against the creature, and dealing sneak attack damage against the target on a successful hit. For every degree of success the creature’s CMD you improve the damage die of this sneak attack by one step (usually 1d6 to 1d8, 1d8 to 1d10).<br><br>If the rogue is not adjacent to the target she may use her Athletics check made as part of this ability to perform a jump to the target, treating this as a jump made as part of a charge. For every 10 feet of distance jumped as part of this the rogue adds an additional +1 to the attack roll to the leaping strike at the end (to a maximum bonus equal to half the rogue’s level). If her jump fails to reach the target this ability automatically fails and the rogue’s movement ends.<br><br>If the rogue using this ability would be subject to fall damage, such as from jumping too high or leaping from a higher surface as part of this ability, the rogue treats the fall as 10 feet plus an additional 10 feet per 3 rogue levels shorter on a successful attack. In addition all fall damage even if it was negated is added to the damage of this attack. If the rogue fails her attack she takes fall damage as normal. |
| Light Steps (Ex)     | \-                                              | By spending 1 stamina as a 4 AP action the rogue may move up to twice her speed, ignoring difficult terrain. While using this ability she may run across any surface; allowing the rogue to move across water, lava, or even the thinnest tree branches. The rogue must end her move on a surface that can support her normally. She cannot move across air in this way, nor can she walk up walls or other vertical surfaces, unless she has some other ability that would allow her to do so. When moving in this way, she does not take damage from surfaces or hazards that react to being touched, such as lava, caltrops, or traps with pressure plates; nor does she need to make Acrobatics checks to avoid falling on slippery or rough surfaces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Perfect Dodge (Ex)   | \-                                              | The rogue can push his reflexes beyond their usual limits to avoid an attack. As a reaction the rogue can spend 2 stamina to cause a melee or ranged attack roll or combat maneuver to automatically miss. If the attack rolls a natural 20 the attack still hits you but is not a critical. The rogue cannot use this ability again without first taking a short rest between uses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Venom Spray          | Greater Venom Master specialization, Rogue 13th | The rogue has learned to turn even her own injury into a weapon. Once per round whenever the rogue is struck by an attack with a piercing or slashing weapon she may spend 1 stamina as an reaction to splash the attacking creature with her deadly blood. Doing so deals an additional 1d4 points of damage to the rogue but allows her Rogue’s Blood poison to be treated as a contact poison with an onset of 1d2 rounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
