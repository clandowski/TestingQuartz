## Rogue’s Insight (Ex)

A rogue knows the importance of where to strike. At 1st level as a 2 AP action the rogue may study a single enemy she can see. Upon doing so she adds half her rogue level as an insight bonus on attack and damage rolls (minimum 1). This effect lasts until that opponent is dead or the rogue studies a new target. This bonus to damage is precision damage. The rogue may spend 1 stamina to use this ability as a reaction. A rogue may only have one target studied in this way at a time, and studying a new target ends this effect immediately. At 8th level the rogue reduces the AP cost of this ability by 1. At 13th level the rogue may use this ability as a reaction once per day plus an additional time per day for every 5 levels the rogue possesses after 13th.

## Rogue Talents (Ex)

A rogue gains access to new abilities that may aid and alter her in combat called Rogue Talents. A rogue gains a rogue talent starting at 2nd level and an additional rogue talent every 2 rogue levels thereafter. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once. If a talent calls for a save attack it is made at 1d20 + ½ MPB + her Focus modifier. The rogue may add her weapon’s enhancement bonus to this save attack.

Only one talent that modifies a rogue’s sneak attack can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision must be made before the attack roll is made.

Additional Rogue Talents may be taken using the Extra Talent feat

For a complete listing of rogue talents see [[./List of Rogue Talents|List of Rogue Talents]]

## Evasion (Ex)

At 3rd level, a rogue gains the Evasion (Martial) feat as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.

## Sneak Attack (Ex)

A rogue learns to strike at a vital spot to deal extra damage when her foe is unable to properly defend themselves. At 3rd level, when making a Focused Attack, or an additional attack as part of a focused attack, and the target of the rogue is flanked by her or is flat-footed, she is capable of dealing extra damage known as a sneak attack. This extra damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every 5 levels of rogue she possesses. Ranged attacks can be sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet + an additional 5 feet per two rogue levels she possesses. Additional damage from a sneak attack is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. The rogue may spend 1 stamina to increase this damage to 1d6 precision damage for every 2 levels of rogue she possesses until the start of her next turn.

With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap or unarmed strike), a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals only lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack—not even with the usual –4 penalty.

A rogue may also force a sneak attack upon a foe she has studied with Rogue’s Insight to carefully find their weak spot. After successfully hitting a rogue may as a free action deal sneak attack damage to that foe even if they wouldn’t normally be subject to a sneak attack. Doing so immediately ends her Rogue’s Insight against that target.

## Nose For Danger (Ex)

At 4th level, a rogue gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor, improving by an additional 1 every 4 rogue levels after 3rd. In addition the rogue is no longer flat-footed if she hasn’t acted yet in combat. At 8th level, a rogue can no longer be flanked; this can prevent another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her (or any other effect that relies on flanking a target), unless the attacker has at least four more hit dice than the rogue does.

## Rogue Specialization (Ex)

At 5th level a rogue learns to further specialize choosing a rogue specialization as well as an additional specialization every 6th level after 5th. These specializations represent how a rogue has honed his skills over the course of his career, usually building upon the rogue’s choice of Niche at 1st level.

For a complete listing of specializations see [[./List of Rogue Specializations|List of Rogue Specializations]]

## Stalker (Ex)

At 6th level the rogue may add half her levels in rogue against the target of her Rogue’s Insight for Disguise, Intimidate, and Stealth checks made against that creature.

## Rogue Trick (Ex)

At 7th level and every six levels thereafter the rogue learns a powerful technique known as a Rogue Trick. These are generally a special kind of action the rogue may take to help her in various situations.

For a complete listing of tricks see Table: Rogue Tricks.

## Agile Precision(Ex)

At 14th level, the rogue reduces the cumulative penalty from making additional attacks during a Focused Attack by 1 (minimum -1). In addition when making a sneak attack the rogue may choose to further increase the AP cost of making a Focused Attack by 1 to improve the damage die of her sneak attack by 1 step (usually 1d6 to 1d8, 1d8 to1d10).

## Master Strike (Ex)

At 20th level, a rogue becomes incredibly deadly when dealing sneak attack damage. Each time the rogue deals sneak attack damage, she can choose one of the following three effects: the target can be put to sleep for 1d4 hours, paralyzed for 2d6 rounds, or slain. Regardless of the effect chosen, the target can attempt a Resilience save to negate the additional effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue’s level + the rogue’s Agility modifier. Once a creature has been the target of a master strike, regardless of whether or not the save is successful, that creature is immune to that rogue’s master strike for 24 hours. Creatures that are immune to sneak attack damage are also immune to this ability.
