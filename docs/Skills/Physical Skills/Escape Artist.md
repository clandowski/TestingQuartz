#### Associated Ability Modifier: Agility
Escape Artist lets you escape bonds and end grapples.

## Common Uses

Escape artist changes depending on the type of restraints you are attempting to escape. This tends to only cover mundane objects and most other items and effects will have their escape artist DCs listed if available.

### Escape Ropes or Other Restraints
When a pinned creature is tied up, the binder makes a combat maneuver check (1d20+MSB+20); this sets the DC of the escape artist check. Some ropes, manacles, or other restraints may have their own special DCs. Attempting to escape requires at least 1 minute of work.

You may repeatedly attempt to escape from ropes or other restraints multiple times; though its assumed if you can't meet the DC with a natural 20, attempting to escape is impossible without some other situational modifiers being introduced.

### Ending A Grapple

You can make an Escape Artist check in place of Physical(Str) check against an attempt to maintain a grapple; alternatively during your turn you may attempt to end it yourself using Escape Artist instead of Physical(Str), using the same action to perform a grapple (usually 3 AP).
