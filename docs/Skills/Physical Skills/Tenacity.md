#### Associated Ability Modifier: Agility
Tenacity is the representation of your raw endurance in times of stress.
## Common Uses

### Tough It Out

Some actions such as running, forced marches, or weather conditions may require a tenacity check to continue going without taking penalties or becoming fatigued/exhausted. See the environment rules for hot weather, starvation for details on the Tenacity DCs in these environments.

#### Continuous Run

A creature can continuously run for a number of rounds equal to 10 + their constitution score. Once a creature has gone beyond this limit they must make a DC 10 Tenacity check to continue running. This check must be repeated each round you continue to run, increasing the DC by 2 for each check you have made previously, and upon a failed check the creature must stop running. If a creature stops running before failing a check, but begins to run again the DC continues from the last highest value they had checked against. If a creature takes a short rest they may begin running as normal without needing to make Tenacity checks.

#### Starvation/Dehydration

A character can go without water for 2 days plus a number of hours equal to their constitution score, after which the character must begin to make Tenacity checks (DC 12, +1 for each previous check) each hour to avoid taking 1d6 points of nonlethal damage.

A character can go without food for 5 days, after which they must make a Tenacity check (DC 12, +1 for each previous check) or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage.

#### Suffocation

A character unable to breathe can hold their breath for a number of rounds equal to their constitution score. If the character has ranks in Tenacity they may add their ranks in Tenacity to the number of rounds they can hold their breath. If a character takes more than a single move action each round the amount of time they can hold their breath is reduced by 1 round. Once a character has run out of rounds of breath they must make a Tenacity check (DC 12, +1 for each previous check) or take 2d10 points of nonlethal damage.

#### Swimming and Exhaustion

Each hour that you are swimming, you must make a DC 20 Tenacity check or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from fatigue.

#### Action/Retry

Tenacity for the Tough it Out action represents an activity, usually over the course of hours or an entire day.

You cannot retry a failed Tenacity check for running, forced march, or weather condition. Though situations may call for additional Tenacity checks.

### Stabilize Self

When a creature is a -1 or lower but not yet dead they are considered dying until they are stabilized. At the start of their turn they must make a DC 15 Tenacity check to stabilize. The creature takes a penalty to this roll equal to the number of negative hit points they are currently at. A creature that is stable is no longer dying, and as such will not lose additional hit points each round, and does not need to make further Tenacity checks to stabilize. If the creature fails this check they remain dying and lose 1 hit point as usual.

#### Action/Retry

Tenacity to stabilize self usually is a non-action taken at the start of the creatureâ€™s turn.

You cannot retry a failed Tenacity check. Though each round usually will call for an additional Tenacity check.
