#### Identify Planes

A creature can make a DC 10 Knowledge(Planes) check to identify the name of a plane, such as the elemental plane of fire. Recognizing the current plane you are on usually increases the DC by an additional 5.

#### Identify Originating Plane of Creature

This is similar to Knowledge(Region) check to identify where they are from rather than details about the creature themselves, but this Knowledge(Planes) check usually starts at a DC 20 increasing by an additional 5 the more rare an exotic the creature or plane of origin they may be.
