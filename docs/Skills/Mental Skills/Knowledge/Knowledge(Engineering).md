#### Identify dangerous construction

Using a DC 10 Knowledge(Engineering) check a creature can identify if a construction would be dangerous or unstable, such as a bridge being unsafe to cross, or a ceiling being close to collapsing.

#### Identify a trap

Identifying a trap is usually DC 10 + the CR of the trap. This provides information about the trap as well as if the trap has been successfully disabled or not after a disable device check has been performed.

#### Determine a structure’s style or age

To identify how old a construction or its source is a DC 15 check. This generally is useful to identify ruins or buildings of a region to identify the style or empire it belongs/belonged to.

#### Determine a structure’s weakness

This can help identify the weakness in a structure, usually a DC 20 engineering check. This can provide a situational bonus (determined by the GM) to a sunder check against an object, or simply find a location with lower hit points or hardness.
