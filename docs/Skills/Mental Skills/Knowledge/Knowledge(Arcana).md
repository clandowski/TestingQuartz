#### Identify A Spell or Rituals

Knowledge(Arcana) can be utilized for various situations regarding spells and spellcasting. Usually the DC is based on the BCB of the spell being cast, and is easier if seen as it is being cast.

|Task|DC|
|---|---|
|Identify as it is being cast|10 + Spell BCB|
|Identify a effect that is in place|15 + Spell BCB|
|Identify a spell/ritual that just targeted you (but did not witness being cast or source).|20 + Spell BCB|

#### Identify Magical Materials

This is utilized to identify materials either being conjured by magic, or enchanted materials such as an enhancement gem/seal. The DC of this is 15 + the spellâ€™s BCB, or BCB of the effect.

#### Identify a Magical Trap

Identifying a magical trap is usually 10+ the CR of the trap being identified. This usually can help with information such as the workings of it, and if it was successfully disabled or not.

#### Decipher a Scroll

When finding a scroll you may not immediately be aware of the spell contained within, and thus a knowledge check is required to decipher it. The check required to identify this DC 15 + the BCB of the spell contained within the scroll.

#### Learn a Spell

When you have access to a spell source or scroll, a prepared caster may attempt to learn the spell and talents it contains and write them into their own spell source using a DC 10 + BCB of the scroll or the original owner of the spell source.

You may also use this check to prepare a spell as if the spells/talents were already contained within your own spell source without needing to go through the process of this. This can be useful if you have lost your own spell source or cannot afford to scribe them into your own spell source.
