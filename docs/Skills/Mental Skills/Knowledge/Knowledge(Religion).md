#### Recognize a deityâ€™s symbol or clergy

A DC 10 Knowledge(Religion) check can identify a deity or clergy of that deity. This DC increases by 10 if the Deity or religion is uncommon, and by 20 if obscure or exotic.

Recalling or Identifying mythology for that religion increases the DC by a further 5.
