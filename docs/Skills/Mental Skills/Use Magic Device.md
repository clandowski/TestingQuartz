Use Magic device is a skill utilized in the activation and general use of a magic item. Unlike other skills you cannot take a 10 on Use Magic device checks, nor can you use aid for a use magic device check.
## Common Uses

### Read Magic or Activate Magic Item

You can use this skill to read a spell (usually contained within a scroll), or to activate a magic item. If you lack the ability to normally activate a scroll you may instead make a Use magic Device check each time you attempt to activate such a device.

### Activate Blindly

When an item has an activation requirement such as a word, thought, or action; you can instead attempt to blindly activate the item as if you knew the requirements to activate it. Activating blindly requires a DC 25 Use Magic Device check, you gain a +2 bonus to this check if youâ€™ve successfully activated the item using this ability before. Failure by two degrees causes a mishap dealing 2d6 damage to yourself, usually untyped, though it may take on a type if the item normally deals damage of a specific type or element.

### Decipher a Spell

This usage works just like deciphering a spell within a spell source with the Knowledge(Arcana) skill, except that the DC is 5 points higher. Deciphering a written spell requires 1 minute of concentration with the spell source.

### Use a Scroll

To cast a spell from a scroll you must have all the components of the spell known already, such as the spell, or any talents associated with the final spell scribed onto the scroll. Use Magic Device allows you to use the scroll without having all the components of the spell. The DC is 10 + the BCB of the spell within the scroll. If you do not possess the base spell of the scroll the DC of this check is increased by 10; for each component such as talents, meta talents, or other similar components, that are not the base spell, you do not possess, the DC increases by an additional 2.

### Cast a Ritual

To cast a ritual without the required affinity talent you must make a DC 15 use magic device check. In addition you may use your ranks in use magic device for BCB requirements of rituals, in addition to using use magic device ranks in place of SPB.

## Action/Retry

Use magic Device is made as part of the action to activate the magic item (usually a 3 AP action, though may vary based on the item).

You may retry in most situations, though if you fail and cause a mishap, you cannot attempt to activate that item again for 24 hours.
