## Common Uses

### Appraise Value of Item

An Appraise check determines the value of an item, though it depends on a number of factors. If you fail an Appraise check by less than 5, you determine the price of that item to within 20% of its actual value. If you fail this check by 5 or more, the price is wildly inaccurate, subject to GM discretion. You may attempt to determine the value of a magic item, though may not determine any magical properties of the item, though without the correct abilities (such as detect magic), you do not become aware if an item is magical or not, and as such can only determine the value of an object as if it lacked the magical properties until made aware of the magical nature of the item.

You can also use this check to determine the most valuable item visible in a treasure hoard. The DC of this check is generally 20 but can increase to as high as 30 for a particularly large hoard.

Much of the appraise skill is subject to GM discretion, but the following chart should be used to assist in setting the appraise DC of an item:

|Item Type|Appraise DC|
|---|---|
|Very Basic Items (Rations, Clothing, Food)|DC 10|
|Common Items (Standard adventuring gear)|DC 15|
|Uncommon Items (Includes low quality gems)|DC 20|
|Rare Items (Includes higher quality gems or ornate items)|DC 25|
|Weapons and Armor (Non Masterwork)|DC 20|
|Weapons and Armor (Masterwork)|DC +5 per rank.|
|Magical Items (identified as magical, but properties not determined)|DC 20 + CL of the item.|
|Magical Item (properties have been identified)|DC 10 + CL of the item.|
|Item is from a famous or well known crafter (and the appraiser is aware of its origins).|DC -5|
|Item is made of an expensive or rare special material.|DC +5|
|Items are significantly damaged, warped, or unable to be easily cleaned.|DC +5|
|Item is significantly antiquated.|DC +2 per 100 years of age.|
|Item is unknown to this region or the one performing the appraise|DC +10|

### Determine Counterfeit or Forgery

You can use Appraise to detect written forgeries and counterfeits, as well as counterfeit coin. The individual forgery determines the DC of the appraise check needed to determine it, but generally the DC to determine a counterfeit starts at DC 20 and is raised or lowered based on the one who crafted the forgery or counterfeit.

#### Action/Retry

Appraising an item takes 3 AP. Determining the most valuable object in a treasure hoard takes 5 AP.

Additional attempts to Appraise an item reveal the same result.
