#### Associated Ability Modifier: Focus
Your senses allow you to notice fine details and alert you to danger. Perception covers all five senses, including sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell.
## Common Uses

Perception has numerous uses; primarily in noticing creatures and objects. Perception is used as a opposed skill check against stealthy opponents. Otherwise perception is used to notice details within the environment. The DCs to notice these details varies depending on conditions, distance, or how noticeable the detail itself is. The following table is a list of adjustments to the DC of a particular perception check.

Perception checks should be made in secret by the GM as a creature would not be aware if they missed something or not or how well their search was done.

## Action/Retry

Most Perception checks are made in reaction to something as some sort of stimulus (such as a creature approaching). Intentionally searching for stimulus is a 2 AP action.

When actively searching you can attempt to search again using a separate action; attempting to sense something you missed the first time.
