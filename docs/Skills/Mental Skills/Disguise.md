#### Associated Ability Modifier: Psyche
You are capable of changing your appearance to that of another.
## Check

Making a disguise check determines how good your resulting disguise is. A disguise check result is then opposed by other creatures’ Perception checks while you maintain the disguise. Creatures don’t automatically make Perception checks against your disguise unless you draw attention to yourself or creatures actively watching (such as a city guard watching commoners at a gate or checkpoint).

Only one Disguise check is made per disguise and is not rerolled after the disguise is made. A Disguise check is made secretly by the GM so the player is unaware how well they did on the disguise.  An individual usually makes a Perception check to see through a disguise upon meeting you and every hour thereafter, though the GM may choose to use an average of perception checks if many creatures will be attempting to see through the disguise.

Disguise has additional cumulative modifiers based on what you’re attempting to change or hide about your appearance.


|Disguise|Disguise Check Modifier|
|---|---|
|Disguised as different gender|–2|
|Disguised as different race|–2|
|Disguised as different age|–2|
|Disguised as different size category|-10 per size difference.|

When attempting to impersonate a specific individual they will receive a bonus to their opposed perception check when attempting to see through your disguise.

## Action/Retry

To create and don a disguise takes 1d4x10 minutes of work. Some magic may reduce the time required.

You may attempt to redo a failed disguise, but creatures may be more actively searching for a disguise once they’ve seen through it.
