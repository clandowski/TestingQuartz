A creature with resistance to elemental damage has the ability to ignore some damage of a certain type per attack, but it does not have total immunity.

Each resistance ability is defined by what Affinity type it resists and a number to indicate power of resistance. The numerical value of the resistance (such as Resist 1 Fire) indicates the bonus to Saves the creature has against spells and effects with the associated elemental affinity. In addition you also reduce the damage of the associated damage type of the resisted affinity by 5 points (as such Resist 3 Fire would reduce incoming fire damage by 15 points); this only applies to sources from spells.

For mundane sources a creature also reduces elemental damage by an amount matching the amount reduced by their resist; for physical damage the creature instead gains DR 1 per point of resist, overcome by the other physical damage types (For example Earth Resist 1 would grant 5 reduction against bludgeoning from spells, and DR 1 overcome by Slashing and Piercing).

Resistance from multiple sources do not stack and the greater of resistance values is instead used unless specified otherwise.
