One of the ways casting type is differentiated between casters is prepared and spontaneous magic. When first gaining the casting class feature the character may decide to be a spontaneous or prepared caster, once chosen all his casting classes are of this type of casting.

# Spontaneous

A spontaneous caster learns talents and spells from their class or feats as they level and when casting in combat may cast any spell and apply talents as appropriate for that spell at the point of casting it.

### First Level Benefits

Spontaneous casters begin play with 2 spells and 1 talent in addition to any other skills or talents granted by their class the first time they gain the spell pool class feature.

### Additional Benefits

Spontaneous casters are locked into the talents they gain and cannot easily gain access to new and different spells, but gain an additional spell point every 2 SPB they possess.

#### Mystic Pool Classes

If your class lacks a spell point pool but has a mystic pool you do not add these bonus spell points to the mystic pool. You instead gain a minor spell pool.

A minor spell point pool contains a maximum number of spell points equal to the bonus spell points gained from the spontaneous casting type. This minor spell point pool refreshes the same as a normal spell point pool. If you gain the spell pool class feature you lose the minor spell point pool and add these spell points to the spell pool as normal.

# Prepared

Prepared casters are more complicated and require more planning than spontaneous casters, but gain more flexibility in their access to various spells when compared to spontaneous casters.

A prepared caster usually draws their spells from an object (called their spell source), such as a spell tome containing their magics or a holy object that is used in religious ceremonies. A prepared caster’s spell source can be virtually anything. Each day after resting to regain spell points, a prepared caster must commune with this spell source to prepare their spells for the day. This process usually requires a full hour of studying, prayer, meditation, or ritual and requires the caster to have access to their spell source.

When a caster first gains levels as a prepared caster they gain their spell source for free. Once a spell source is lost or destroyed it must be replaced by spending at least 100 gp on a suitable replacement item. A character may write any talents currently prepared but not yet expanded into a new spell source. A character may have more than one spell source, such as for having a backup, but may only prepare spells from a single spell source at a time.

While prepared casters still gain spells and talents from their class levels or feats, these do not automatically grant the caster access to a new spell or talent in their spell source (unless it is granting a specific spell or talent); instead these work as slots.

### Preparing Spells

Preparing your spells is a two step process of selecting your spells and talents, and assembling your spells.

#### Selecting Spells and Talents

Unlike a spontaneous caster, a prepared caster’s talents and spells are treated as slots; these slots are empty until they are filled each day from your spell source. When preparing spells each day you empty out these slots and choose new spells and talents from your spell source.

Spells or talents selected must be able to fill the type of slot (a feature that grants specifically a spell can only receive a spell; a feature that grants a talent or spell can receive both). If a feature grants you a specific bonus spell or talent, that spell or talent is always considered to be prepared in its granted slot as long as you have access to your spell source and that slot cannot be used for another spell or talent.

Any prerequisites such as a required talent must be met at the point of preparation (an affinity talent is a prerequisite to most spells and must be prepared, you do not count as meeting the prerequisites from simply having that affinity talent within your spell source).

Once these slots have been filled, you may begin assembling your spells.

#### Assembling Your Spells

Once your talent and spell slots are filled, a prepared caster must still assemble each spell before it can be cast. An assembled spell is usually the spell plus any additional talents or other variable options of the spell defined into a finalized form, and each assembled spell is called a “spell charge.” When creating a spell charge, you pay any required spell point costs when the spell is assembled rather than when it is cast (including any additional cost for talents that are applied to the spell, and the additional cost to allow the spell to continue without concentration if applicable). A prepared caster may only have a number of spell charges prepared equal to his casting ability modifier plus his levels in prepared casting classes.

Once cast, the spell charge is spent and cannot be cast again, except for spells without a required spell point cost (such as Elemental Blast with no talents applied). If a spell without a required spell point cost is assembled into a spell charge where the only spell points used are discretionary (such as Alter Light with a spell point spent to allow it to continue without concentration) the no-cost version of that spell may be used as long as the spell charge has not yet been expended (example: Alter Light could be cast with a duration of concentration multiple times, but once the spell charge is spent to allow it to continue without concentration it cannot be cast again as a concentration duration unless a separate spell charge was prepared for this).

A caster may scrap a prepared spell charge (effectively discarding it) as a free action on their turn. If the scrapped charge was assembled using any number of spell points, the caster regains 1 spell point (charges assembled using multiple spell points do not yield additional spell points when scrapped).

If the caster has spell points remaining and is not already at the maximum number of allowed spell charges prepared (either through having not prepared them or from having spent charges), the caster may spend 10 minutes of preparation per spell charge to assemble a new charge. This does not allow a caster to go above their maximum number of spell charges.

Example: Consider a 1st level caster with a +3 casting ability modifier and whose spell source contains Alter Light, Darkness, Elemental Blast, and Elemental Cone. The caster in this example gained Dark Affinity as a bonus talent at first level as well as two talents from his class levels (one of which was spent on Alter Light, which granted him the Darkness talent). Due to this, he is always considered to have Dark Affinity prepared in his bonus slot (as this is not a variable slot).

As he has two slots from his class levels, an additional slot gained at 1st SPB as a prepared caster (see Additional Benefits below), and is always considered to have the Dark Affinity talent prepared, he may prepare the Darkness talent (the Alter Light spell is free to prepare, but cannot be used without the Darkness talent also prepared), the Elemental Blast spell, and the Elemental Cone talent in those 3 slots.

As he has a casting ability modifier of 3 and 2 levels in a prepared casting class, the caster can have up to 5 spell charges. As such, he could choose to prepare spell charges for Elemental Blast unmodified by any talents, 2 instances of Elemental Blast modified by the Elemental Cone talent (with a required cost of 1 spell point each), 2 instances of Alter Light modified by the Darkness talent with the spell point cost paid to allow it to continue without concentration (1 each), and reserve 1 spell point for later.

With this set, he could cast unmodified Elemental Blast as many times per day as he wished, could cast Elemental Blast modified by the Elemental Cone talent twice, and could cast Alter Light without concentrating once without losing the ability to cast it through concentration without expending a charge (casting it a 2nd time without concentration would spend the last charge, and the caster would need to prepare a new charge for Alter Light to cast it again with or without concentration).

### Obtaining New Spells

To obtain new spells or talents, a prepared caster must inscribe it (or perform a ritual that is appropriate for their spell source) into their spell source from a scroll or from another spell source. The caster may inscribe spells or talents he does not meet the prerequisites for (such as a minimum BCB), but still cannot prepare them unless he meets all the prerequisites for that spell or talent.

This process takes 1 hour to do and the caster must pay an amount of gold to cover expensive materials involved, which is calculated by the higher of their BCB or the required BCB of the spell multiplied by 30 gp (example: a 3 BCB caster would need to pay 90 gp to inscribe a new spell into his spell source).

### First Level Benefits

Unlike a spontaneous caster, prepared casters gain 2 spells and a talent as spells pre-inscribed into their spell source, rather than as bonus talents. In addition prepared spellcasters automatically start with Ritual Casting Initiate as a bonus magic feat and may store rituals within their spell source in addition to their normal spells and talents.

### Additional Benefits

Prepared casters gain an additional slot to fill with a talent or spell when preparing spells at 1st SPB, and every 4 SPB they possess thereafter.

In addition, a prepared caster may choose to spend a spell charge to fuel a non-spell ability, such as a class feature, that requires spell points. Doing so scraps the spell charge (effectively discarding it), but grants the caster a number of temporary spell points equal to the spell points assembled into the spell charge. This requires no action, as it is a part of activating the ability that the spell points are fueling, and any remaining spell points leftover are lost at the start of the caster’s next turn.
