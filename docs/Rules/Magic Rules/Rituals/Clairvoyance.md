keywords: Divination

casting_time: 10 minutes.
component_cost: 150 gp
prerequisites: " 5 BCB, Water (Essence) affinity talent."
duration: 1 minute per BCB
description: This ritual upon completion creates an invisible magic sensor at a specific location that allows the caster to hear or see as if they were in the location. The targeted location must be a location familiar to the caster, but otherwise the caster does not need line of effect. Once selected the sensor does not move, but can rotate to offer different directional views to the caster. This spell does not allow magic or supernatural senses to work through it; for example if a creature’s darkvision is granted through magic and is not normally available to the creature, they will be unable to see anything in a location that would be too dark to see without darkvision. This spell only works on the plane the creature is currently occupying.
