component_cost: 1,500 gp
prerequisites: 12th BCB, Void (Air-Anima) affinity talent
duration: Instantaneous
description: This ritual moves the caster to another plane of existence or alternate dimension. You may also bring one additional willing creature of medium size or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) per three BCB levels. Plane Shift is imprecise and transports creatures between 5 and 500 miles from their intended destination (5d100). The creature casting plane shift must have some knowledge of the destination plane (usually through research or have been to the plane previously); if the creature knows of the plane but has no specific destination within the destination plane, the location becomes random, though usually is within a similar environment the creature transported from as this is a place the caster is familiar with. Creatures must cast plane shift again to return to their home plane.
