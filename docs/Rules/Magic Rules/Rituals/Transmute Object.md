keywords: Transmutation
cost: 3,000 gp
casting_time: 4 hours (see text)
component_cost: 400 gp
prerequisites: 2nd BCB, Earth (Water-Anima) affinity talent.
duration: Instantaneous
description: You utilize the power of magic to help speed up the time required to craft an object. Transmuting an object breaks down the base materials and allows the caster of the ritual to reconfigure them into a finished product. This otherwise functions crafting (profession, potion crafting, scroll crafting, magic item craft, etc…) but counts as a full 8 hours of work for a day of progress from the crafter. At 4th BCB and every 4 thereafter the time required to cast this ritual is reduced by half (2 hours, 1 hour, 30 minutes, 15 minutes, etc..). Casting the ritual is draining and prevents the caster from performing additional crafts per day as if they had spent the full 8 hours crafting.
