This follow-up ritual has no component cost but does require 1 minute of time to cast. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing creature of medium size or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) per three BCB levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth. Unwilling creatures or creatures with spell resistance, besides you, are subject to a will save attack against this ability.
