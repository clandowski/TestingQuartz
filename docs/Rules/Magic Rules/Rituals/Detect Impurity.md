description: You may attempt to detect the presence or absence of a disease or poison in an area of 5 feet plus 5 feet per 4 BCB around you. Make a check of 1d20 + SPB + CAM. If your check meets or exceeds the DC of the disease or poison you become aware of it and know what square it is located in; an additional degree of success allows you to pinpoint the exact object. You may make a Knowledge(Nature) check against the DC of the disease or poison to identify the specific type of disease or poison present; an appropriate profession check may be made instead, such as Profession(Toxicologist) when dealing with poisons.
