Implements are the channeling force casters use to cast their spells. Most casters have some sort of item such as a wand, staff, lute, holy symbol, or some other object (determined by your classes) to cast spells through. Unless otherwise specified a caster cannot cast without their implement without making a concentration check with a DC of 20 + 2x the BCB of the spell; a caster must be holding their implement in some way when casting a spell or suffer the same penalty as if they lacked it. An implement may be drawn and held as part of casting a spell as long as the spell requires a standard action or longer to cast and the caster has a limb capable of holding or wielding the implement. If a player has level in multiple casting classes he may choose a single implement from the list of allowed implements from any classes they possess.

An implement with an enhancement bonus grants its enhancement bonus to attack, damage, and save attacks for spells the implement wielder casts.

If the caster is not holding their implement and they do not have at least one hand free (such as being bound or holding a weapon or object), the concentration DC to cast without their implement is increased by an additional 5.

The shape of an implement is mostly for flavor, and any melee attacks made with them are treated as improvised weapons. While a staff may be chosen it is not a quarterstaff meant for combat and as such remains improvised. Some classes and other features may allow weapons to count as implements or improve the combat ability of an implement.
