benefit: An extended spell lasts twice as long as normal. A spell with a duration of concentration, instantaneous, or permanent is not affected by this effect, but you may choose to activate this talent when spending a spell point to make a spell you are concentrating on last without concentration, rather than when you initially cast the spell. Using this talent costs an additional spell point in addition to the original cost of the spell.
