benefit: You may increase the casting time of your spell by 1 AP to imbue that spell into a handheld item (such as a glass bead, a paper charm, or a bottle of liquid). You, or another creature, may activate this item as a 3 AP action when it is held in hand. These items remain potent for 24 hours, or until you next replenish your spell points (whichever comes first), and are considered scrolls or potions for any effects which modify or interact with scrolls and potions.
special: If you are a prepared spellcaster, you may imbue any number of items as a part of assembling your spells.
