benefit: When casting a spell you may deliver it through a single weapon attack. When using this talent make a single weapon attack, if the  target is struck by the attack, it is also affected by the spell. This may only be used with spells that target a single creature, or have the option to target a single creature, for their effect. This uses the attack type of the weapon rather than the spell’s such as going against normal AC instead of Touch AC if the utilized weapon would not target Touch. If the spell calls for a save attack you must still make a save attack as normal to determine the effect of the spell in addition to the melee attack. Any damage from this ability is treated as extra damage on the weapon and is not multiplied on a critical hit from the weapon. Spells cast this way do not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless the weapon attack would normally provoke.
