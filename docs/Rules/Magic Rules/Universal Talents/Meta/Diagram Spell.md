benefit: You may draw a diagram and imbue it with a spell for later use. Drawing a diagram takes 10 minutes to etch, paint, or draw the magical diagram into a single square the size of a medium sized creature. For every size category above medium the time required to draw the diagram is doubled. Once a diagram is drawn as part of completing the diagram the spellcaster may imbue it with a single spell, spending all spell points as normal. As a 3 AP action the caster may touch the diagram activating the spell within the diagram. Creatures within the area of the diagram are each targeted by the spell stored within; if the spell targets an area of effect it is only cast once but is cast within the area of the diagram; the spell does not affect any area or creatures outside of the diagram.<br><br>Once the spell within has been cast the diagram becomes inert, but the caster may choose to re-pay any spell point costs incurred in creating the diagram, as a 3 AP action, to re-enable the spell created within the diagram; this is similar to as if the caster had created a new diagram using the exact same spell, but without needing to spend the time drawing a new diagram; though a caster must still spend another 3 AP action to activate the spell manually once it has been recharged and cannot activate it as part of recharging the diagram. The diagram must still be present and unharmed to reactivate it, and may not recharge a destroyed diagram.<br><br>A caster may only have a total number of diagrams active at one time equal to his casting ability modifier. Spells within the diagram last up to 24 hours before becoming inert.
special: At 5th BCB you may take this talent a second time. If taken a second time you may add a triggering condition to the spell, such as “an enemy touches the diagram” or “a creature reads the runes”, causing the spell to be cast as if you activated the diagram manually. The caster cannot trigger their set conditions for their own spell and must still spend a 3 AP action to activate it manually.
