benefit: You may spend an additional spell point when casting a spell to affect 1 plus 1 per 5 BCB additional targets. All targets must be within 30 feet of each other and you must have line of effect to all targets.
special: "You may take this talent multiple times. Each time that you do, you gain one of the following options (gained in order each time the talent is taken): (1) targets may be any distance from each other as long as you have line of effect to each target and each target is within your range, (2) targets no longer require you to have line of effect from you as long as they have line of effect from another target, (3) you may spend two more additional spell points to affect all targets within the spell’s range (you may always choose to exclude yourself), (4) you may exclude a number of additional targets from this effect equal to your CAM."
