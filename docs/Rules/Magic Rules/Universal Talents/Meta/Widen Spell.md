benefit: You can increase an area spell (such as a radius, burst, cone, line, or cylinder spell). Any numeric measurements of the spell’s area increase by 100%. Spells that do not have an area of one of these sorts are not affected by this feat. Using this talent costs an additional 3 spell points in addition to the original cost of the spell.<br>If applied to a line spell you may instead choose to increase the width of the line instead of length, causing it to affect an additional set of squares parallel to the original line.
