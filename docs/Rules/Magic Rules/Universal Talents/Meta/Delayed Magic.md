benefit: You delay the effect of a spell for up to 5 rounds after you use it, +1 round per BCB. You must select the amount of delay when using the effect. The area or target to be affected must be within range when the ability is used, but need not remain in your range (you or it may move) before the effect activates. Using this talent costs an additional spell point in addition to the original cost of the spell.
