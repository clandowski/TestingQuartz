benefit: "You may add the following traits:<br><br>- Dodge: The target gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC.<br>- Initiative: The target gains quickened reactions, granting a +4 competence bonus to initiative.<br>- Lunge: Choose one natural attack the target possesses. Once per round when making an attack you may treat your reach as double with that natural weapon with a +2 bonus to its attack roll.<br>- Leaping Attack: As a 4 AP action, the target may jump, making a single attack action at any point during the leap. It does not provoke an attack of opportunity for leaving a threatened square. At 5th BCB you may instead use this ability as a focused attack action movement made as part of this jump counts against your movement for the round. At 10th BCB you may instead use this ability as an attack action instead of a focused attack action.<br>- Pounce: The target may make a full-attack after a charge. Granting this trait costs an additional spell point."
