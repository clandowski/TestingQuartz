title: Universal Talents
---
Below is a list of universal talents. Universal talents are unique in that they allow for the modification of spells without being tied to a single specific spell, or in the case of affinity talents work as a baseline to meet the prerequisites of other spells.

While Affinity talents are also universal talents they are listed separately for ease of viewing; but affinity talents can be of several sub-categories, such as Meta talents

## Affinity Talents

Affinity talents are a unique type of talent in that they serve multiple purposes. They work as a baseline for many spell qualifications, unlocking various spells when they’re picked up, usually at least one is granted by a class at first level. They assist spells with the elemental _Keyword'_: to define the damage type of the spell. A number also functions as a spell granting some minor ability.

All affinity talents have an Essence or Anima version which represent opposing forces of that element. A creature must select once the talent is acquired, though some classes may also define if you obtain the Essence or Anima effect as well. Gaining an affinity talent a second time does not grant the opposite effect and instead feats or other effects must be taken to gain the opposite side of their affinity talents.

| Affinity                           | Essence | Essence Damage Type | Anima | Anima Dmage Type |
| ---------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------- | ----- | ---------------- |
| [Air Affinity](Air Affinity)       | Air     | Slashing            | Void  | Void             |
| [Fire Affinity](Fire Affinity)     | Fire    | Fire                | Cold  | Cold             |
| [Nature Affinity](Nature Affinity) | Nature  | Nature              | Decay | Decay            |
| [Water Affinity](Water Affinity)   | Water   | Piercing            | Earth | Bludgeoning      |


## Alter Talents

Similar to form talents, alter talents can be used in polymorphing. The major difference is alter talents are simply a collection of traits and do not replace the creature’s base form but simply add to it, as such they are commonly used with transformation or alter self for generalized changes such as becoming larger or smaller.

## Form Talents

These talents list a number of forms that polymorph (or similar) spells can use. A form talent lists various pieces of information about the type of creature mimicked; such as limbs, speed, and traits. Features such as speech indicate if you can speak your normal languages (without additional magical assistance) in this form, as well as hands to indicate the ability to manipulate objects as a normal humanoid character. If a form or alter talent grants the same trait (such as Darkvision 60 feet) it does not stack and still cannot be applied more than once.

## Meta Talents

Meta talents is the overall term used to describe talents that can apply to almost all, if not all, spells. These tend to be common talents that exist to be taken to make a caster overall more versatile. A character must know at least one spell before they can select a meta universal talent.
