essence_special: This talent allows you the ability to as a 3 AP action you can cause vibrations within the air to create false sounds within close range. This allows you to create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of sound this creates when casting it and cannot thereafter change the sound’s basic character.<br><br>The volume of sound created depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per BCB (maximum 40 humans). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise this talent produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from 16 humans, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise from 32 humans. Anyone who hears sounds from this talent receives a Mental save to disbelieve.

anima_special: In addition this talent allows you the ability to as a 3 AP action you may attempt to lift an object weighing no more than 5 lbs and move it up to 15 feet using telekinetic force, up to a maximum distance of close range. This movement does not produce enough force to be used offensively, and objects dropped using this fall slowly and harmlessly back to the ground.
