You may apply this trait more than once, each time selecting an additional elemental type to gain resistance against.</li><li>Blazing Speed (requires fire affinity): The target gains a +10 enhancement bonus to its land speed improving by 10 every 5 BCB. When taking the charge action creatures adjacent to the charge path (including the creature at the end of the charge) are subject to a Physical(Agi) save attack or take 1d6 + BCB fire damage; a failed save attack negates this damage.</li><li>Water Stride (requires water affinity): The target gains a swim speed equal to their land speed, the ability to breathe water freely, and may walk upon the surface of water as if it were solid ground. In addition a creature with this trait takes no penalties when attacking underwater.</li><li>Personal Winds (requires wind affinity): Ranged attacks against a creature with this trait take a penalty against the creature as if they were affected by Tier 3 wind.
