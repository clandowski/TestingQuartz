benefit: You grant the form of a humanoid creature.

Natural_Weapons: 
AC_Adjustment: 
special: The creature takes on the form of a type of humanoid creature, chosen when the spell is cast (such as elf, human, dwarf, etc..). The spell does not directly copy the features of a creature, but rather finds the approximation of what the altered creature would look like as the member of that race (generally meaning the creature will look like a unique individual and will look like that every time they take on that form). This removes the penalty for disguising as a member of that race if your normal race would be different. This does not alter the creature’s size and will require traits from size change or similar talents to accomplish. If adjusted via other traits, such as gaining additional legs via alter limbs, you may use this talent to grant the form of a monstrous humanoid as long as the resulting transformation would have appropriate limbs and general shape; this talent does not affect size but may be used with size change to reach the appropriate size for the resulting race.
Traits: "The following traits may be granted for any form:<ul><li>Detailed Transformation: You may alter the form of your transformation to take on the aspects of a different gender or age for your appearance; removing the penalties to disguise checks for attempts to disguise as a different age or gender. You may also use this to change your voice to be unrecognizable, but cannot use it to directly imitate the voice of another.</li><li>Stolen Features: If you are familiar with how another creature looks you may attempt to alter your transformation to better match them gaining a bonus equal to 1 + ½ SPB to disguise checks to appear as that individual. If combined with Detailed Transformation in addition to its normal effects of removing the penalties to disguise you may also directly mimic the target creature’s voice. If you are not directly familiar with the creature, or directly able to study their features, the bonus to disguise checks is reduced by half as you are more likely to miss an important detail in the transformation. If you apply this trait to a form not appropriate to their race you may still attempt to disguise as them, but take the usual penalties for trying to appear as a member of that race.</li><li>Grant Sentience: When this trait is applied to a creature of animal intelligence (1 or 2 intelligence) the creature’s intelligence is immediately raised by an amount equal to your SPB, if this would raise the creature’s intelligence above 2 the creature gains the ability to speak and understand a single language you know. If this would raise the creature’s intelligence high enough to gain additional skill points they may gain skill ranks in skills you have ranks in. When this effect ends the creature returns to their original state, and while they may retain memories from their time they may not have the intelligence to fully process or comprehend such memories and thus usually return to their normal state; though may regain access to these memories when this effect is applied again.</li></ul>"
