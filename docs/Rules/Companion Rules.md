Below dictates the information, progression, and options given to a conjuration companion. While SPB is defined as its progression indicator some classes may not have a SPB or may emulate their levels as SPB for the purposes of progression on this chart.

For the purposes of games that may go past 20th or the rare cases that allow a companion’s progression to go beyond the normal rate this chart goes 40th.

When a companion is first created it must select a base form and a type; once chosen this defines the base properties of the creature, and further talents may be purchased to further customize the abilities of this creature.

Companions gained through class features may not have talents applied to them from sources besides the class they were granted from, though multiple sources of SPB may still determine their progression. Companions gained from similarly named class features (such as two classes having the Animal Companion) class feature may treat such classes as the same source and benefit from talents granted by those classes.

   For example a wizard may have the summon companion spell, and the animal companion from ranger, but his spell talents may only affect his summon companion spell, while the talents gained from ranger may only ever affect his animal companion class feature companion.

## Companion Features

- **Base Size**: Medium. You may choose to make a companion Small-sized instead of Medium-sized. In this case, the companion gains the usual changes for being Small.
- **Spell Prowess Bonus**: This is an indicator of the SPB of the summoner that summoned the companion. This helps indicate what hit dice and other features the companion possesses.
- **Skill Ranks**: A companion gains 2+Int Modifier skill points per hit die.
- **Hie Die**: All companions have a d8 hit die. Gaining average hit points plus 5. Hit die progresses at a rate of one hit die per SPB of the caster.
- **Natural Armor**: Companion's selected form usually determines their natural armor as well as the rate it progresses.
- **Saves**: A companion has 2 good saves and 1 bad save determined at creation.
- **Languages**: A companion begins understanding and speaking one language that the caster also speaks.
- **Feats**: A companion begins with one feat, and gains another feat at every odd Hit Dice. A companion may gain any feat for which it qualifies.
- **Ability Score Increase**: Just like player characters and monsters, a companion gains a permanent +1 inherent bonus to an ability score of the caster’s choice for every Hit Dice possessed plus an additional +1 every even hit dice. A single stat cannot have more than ½ the creature’s hit dice rounded up in inherent bonus for a single stat.
- **Devotion**: At 6 Hit Dice, a companion gains a +4 morale bonus on saves against mind-affecting keyword spells and effects.
- **Maximum Traits**: Similar to creatures under the effects of the Transformation or Alter Self spells a companion gains traits. These traits are drawn from a list of traits available to their form, or others based on other form or alter talents the caster may have access to, similar to the transformation and alter self spells. A companion gains access to a single trait gaining an additional trait for every 5 hit dice it possesses.

## Creating a Companion

### Base Form

Aspects of the companion must first be determined. When you gain a companion either the spell or feature granting the companion will either grant, or allow the selection of a single form talent. This form talent is applied to the creature similar to a creature, but rather than modifying a creature it determines the shape and general form of the creature, along with any other abilities it might possess.

### Saving Throws

A companion gains 2 good and 1 bad save of their choice. Once this selection is made for the particular companion it cannot be changed.
## Ability Scores

Companions gain a stat array of 16, 16, 12, 10, 10, 8 which may be distributed between their ability scores as desired.
### Companion Type

Once the base form has been chosen a companion type must be chosen. This is usually a theme, such as animal, construct, ooze, or other such thing that defines more about the creature rather than just its form. Types usually contain additional benefits or even detriments, but also give the companion a creature type.

### Companion Traits

A companion gains a number of traits to choose from; usually gained from their base form. A companion may have a maximum number of traits equal to 1 + 1 per 5 Hit Dice. These traits usually cannot be changed once selected for the companion without creating a new companion.

## Companion Base Forms

Below are the base forms each companion must choose when first gained, some classes may pre-choose what shape the companion takes. Overall the form is meant to simply be a chassis for your companion for which everything builds on.

## Companion Types

A type defines much of the theme of a companion once the base form is chosen. A companion may only benefit from a single type (unless otherwise noted). Many types have an affinity associated with them, and this is important for any caster wishing to take the Summon Companion spell; some classes may grant a type without the need to meet this prerequisite.

Each companion type has an associated creature type as well; outside of counting as a creature of this type the companion gains no other benefits related to this type, unless otherwise specified.

## Companion Talents

All companion talents can be selected as magic talents by casters who have the summon companion spell. Some companion talents may be granted by some classes without needing to meet this prerequisite, though usually limit the selection when doing so. Unless otherwise specified companion talents apply only to a single companion and must be bought separately for each companion they apply to (though some talents and abilities may allow a talent to apply to all).

Some companion talents grant access to new traits available only to companions, while others may simply grant a direct benefit to a companion.

If a companion talent has a spell point cost the cost must be paid by the summoner/owner of the companion rather than the companion itself; though some companions may gain the ability to pay the cost themselves.
