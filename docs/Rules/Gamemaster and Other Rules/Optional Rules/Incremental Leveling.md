This set of rules is for campaigns that don’t level up frequently, or for groups that find the sudden (and sometimes large) power boost unrealistic compared to a character working their way up to their newfound power. When using these rules at every quarter of a level a character receives (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) they may chose to gain one of the following bonuses from their next level early:

- BAB, BDB, MPB, SPB, and BCB
- Hit Dice, Ability Score Increases, and Saves
- Class Features
- Spells, Talents, Feats, and Class pools (Spell Points, Stamina, and Ki for example)

This does not guarantee gains for each level as a ½ BAB character for example may not see their BAB go up next level, this simply lets them count their level as one higher when calculating that portion of their character.

It is important to track these values carefully as while some parts would increase, other parts will not; such as BAB, and MPB increasing but Stamina increasing as a separate bonus.

At 100% of the XP required you gain the last item on the list that has yet to be selected, as well as finalize any other bonuses your character may gain from a level up, as your character has now officially reached their next level.
