## Class Details
Hit Die:  d10
Type: Creature

Requirements: Must possess the Elemental type. If taken at 1st level the creature must be small.

An elemental is a being of pure energy, highly attuned to a single element, rarely multiple. These creatures while similarly attuned highly to elements like Angels, Demons, and Devils, are simply composed entirely of their attuned element.

## Class Features

The following are class features of an elemental.

### Weapon and Armor Proficiency

An elemental gains no additional weapon or armor proficiencies.

### Elemental Attunement

When an elemental gains their first level, they must select a single type of elemental from the list. This grants Immunity and Resist 3 for their selected element, as well as listed vulnerability. In addition the elemental gains an associated affinity talent appropriate to their type.

- Light Elemental: Light Affinity; Vulnerability: Nature, Entropy
- Dark Elemental: Dark Affinity; Vulnerability: Light, Entropy
- Nature Elemental: Nature Affinity; Vulnerability: Dark, Cold
- Water Elemental: Water Affinity; Vulnerability: Nature, Electric
- Fire Elemental: Fire Affinity; Vulnerability: Dark, Water.
- Cold Elemental: Cold Affinity; Vulnerability: Light, Fire
- Earth Elemental: Earth Affinity; Vulnerability: Cold; Additional Immunity: Electric
- Electric Elemental: Electric Affinity; Additional Immunity: Earth
- Wind Elemental: Wind Affinity; Vulnerability: Fire
- Entropy Elemental: Entropic Affinity; Vulnerability: Water, Wind

### Mystic Pool

An elemental learns to push their natural energies to create both the magical and extraordinary. This pool contains a number of points equal to his levels in elemental. A mystic pool may be used as a stamina or a spell point pool, though it does not stack with either when determining the size of either pool. Similar to a stamina and spell point pool, a mystic pool restores itself after a long rest.

At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter the mystic pool’s size increases by an additional 1. If they obtain a mystic pool from another class or source he may combine the pools and their levels to determine the total capacity of the mystic pool. If this is the character’s first level in a class their mystic pool’s capacity increases by an additional 2.

Unlike normal classes, creature classes do not count as either Martial or Casting classes for the purposes of determining MPB and SPB, and if this is their first level in a martial or magic class, despite having a mystic pool.

### Basic Elemental Magic (Su)

At 1st level, all elementals gain Wield Element as a natural spell and may use it with the associated affinity talent of their elemental type (such as Cold, Water, Fire, etc..). This natural spell may be cast by spending 1 mystic pool point using their levels in elemental as their BCB and their SPB. In addition the elemental’s base mystic pool capacity improves by 2 points.

In addition should the elemental gain access to spellcasting or levels in a spellcasting class they may use their levels in elemental as levels in a casting class with a BCB and SPB equal to their levels in elemental, but only for spells of their associated affinity. This does not stack with other feats or abilities that would allow the elemental to count these class levels as levels in a spellcasting class.

### Elemental Body

At 1st level, the elemental gains immunity to bleed, poison, and sleep effects. Due to having no defined shape or vitals, the creature is immune to flanking and critical hits.

In addition, elemental becomes more difficult to dissipate with mundane methods, gaining DR 2/Magic. This DR improves by 2 for every 4 levels of elemental it possesses.

Finally, all natural weapons possessed by the elemental deal elemental damage matching their elemental damage type rather than the normal damage type for their respective natural weapons.

### Elemental Ray

At 2nd level, all elementals gain Elemental Blast as a natural spell and may use it with the associated affinity talent of their elemental type (such as Cold, Water, Fire, etc..). This natural spell may be cast using their levels in elemental as their BCB and their SPB. The elemental may spend mystic pool points when utilizing an effect that would require a spell point when casting elemental blast. In addition the elemental gains Focused Element magic feat as a bonus feat for their elemental type.

### Elemental Talents

At 2nd level, an elemental gains access to magic spells and talents. Spells learned through this feature may only be spells capable of being cast with their affinity talent of their elemental type. Spells learned through this feature are cast as natural spells by the elemental using their levels in elemental as their BCB and their SPB. The elemental may only learn talents that use a natural spell they already possess as a prerequisite. The elemental may use their levels in elemental to determine their BCB to qualify for spells and talents.

### Elemental Trait

At 3rd level, and every 3 levels thereafter, the elemental gains one of the following traits. Unless otherwise specified each of these traits may only be taken once. Talents that call for a save attack are made at 1d20 + ½ the elemental’s hit dice + the elemental’s charisma modifier.

- Deadly Body: Creatures striking the elemental with unarmed strikes or natural weapons take 1d6 elemental damage matching the elemental’s damage type; this damage improves by 1d6 at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter. This talent may be taken an additional time, allowing this ability to extend to all non-reach melee weapon attacks made against the elemental.
- Elemental Aura: The crackling energy of the elemental flares and strikes randomly around the elemental granting them a 5 foot aura of damage matching the elemental’s damage type. The elemental aura deals 1d4 damage, improving by one step for every 5 levels of elemental. This talent may be taken an additional time at 9th level, and again at 15th, improving the area of the aura by 5 feet each time, to a maximum of 15 feet.
- Greater Strikes: The elemental’s natural weapons deal additional elemental damage, matching the elemental’s damage type, equal to the elemental’s charisma modifier. The elemental must be at least 9th level before selecting this elemental trait.
- Stone Strikes(Earth Elemental): The earth elemental transforms their natural weapons into solid stone. Natural weapons possessed by the earth elemental deal damage appropriate for their natural weapon type (bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing), rather than matching their elemental type.
- Slow And Steady(Earth, Entropic, or Nature Elemental): The Elemental takes a -10 penalty to their movement speed, but may add their levels in elemental as a class bonus to their CMB and CMD for Reposition and Trip combat maneuvers.

### Elemental Force

At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter the elemental increases in size by one size category. In addition the elemental’s damaging spells deal an additional +1 damage and have their maximum range improved by 5 feet for each size category above medium they possess from this class feature.

### Elemental Motion

At 5th level, the elemental may select one of the movement types listed below. Their elemental type may restrict which movement modes they may select. At 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter the elemental may select an additional movement type or improve the speed of the selected type by an additional 20 feet.

- Improved Land Speed(Light, Nature, Fire, Electric, Wind): +20 ft.
- Fly Speed(Light, Fire, Electric, Wind): 30 ft. (Perfect)
- Swim Speed (Water, Dark, Entropy, Cold): 30 ft.
- Burrow Speed (Dark, Nature, Earth, Entropy): 30 ft.

### Elemental Absorption

At 7th level, the elemental gains further affinity with their chosen element. When the elemental would receive damage of its chosen element, the elemental is healed by that amount, despite being otherwise immune. The elemental may not use this to heal through elemental damage they deal to themselves.

### Intermediate Elemental Magic

At 9th level, the elemental gains a bonus to all damage rolls with damaging elemental spells equal to half their levels in elemental. In addition the elemental gains Irresistible Element as a bonus feat.

### Magic Control

At 11th level, the elemental gains dispel magic with the counterspell, and greater counterspell talents as a natural spell, spending mystic pool points in place of spell points. If the elemental already had this spell or any of the talents already as a natural spell it gains a +2 to their dispel check. The elemental may only use this ability to counter or dispel spells matching their associated elemental affinity. At 13th level the elemental no longer needs to spend an additional point to use the greater counterspell talent.

At 17th level, the elemental gains the area dispel talent as a natural spell usable with their dispel magic natural spell. If the elemental already possessed this talent they improved the radius by an additional 10 feet.

### Reshape Self

At 13th level, the elemental gains greater control over their form and may reduce their size category to a minimum of medium size as a standard action. The elemental may release this ability as a move action; if creatures are in the area the elemental would occupy at his final adjusted size they take a number of points of elemental damage of the elemental’s type equal to the hit dice the elemental possesses and pushed to a space adjacent to the elemental.

### Greater Elemental Magic

At 16th level, the elemental gains a +2 bonus to BCB for all spells and natural spells they cast with their associated elemental affinity.

### Greater Magic Control

At 17th level, the elemental gains a +4 competence bonus on attack rolls, AC rolls, damage rolls, and save attack rolls against creatures with the affinity talent matching their elemental affinity. This benefit includes creatures with natural spells with this affinity, spontaneous casters, or prepared casters who currently have the affinity talent prepared.

### Elemental Titan

At 19th level, the elemental’s natural weapons damage increases by two steps, and in addition the elemental gains an additional 5 feet of reach.

### Elder Elemental Magic

At 20th level, the elemental automatically ignores all immunity to an element a creature would possess against their elemental spells matching their chosen affinity, this applies to all elemental damage the elemental deals; elemental resistance may still apply as normal.
