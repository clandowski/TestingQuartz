## Class Features

The following are class features of a Humanoid.

### Weapon and Armor Proficiency

A humanoid is proficient with no weapons or armor. If this is the character’s first level in a class they gain proficiency in a single simple weapon (usually something similar to a tool the creature regularly works with) and a single light simple armor.

At 1st level, a humanoid gains access to a pool of stamina points that allow them to perform feats of strength and agility. This pool contains a number of stamina points equal to their Constitution modifier plus their levels in martial classes (minimum 1). This pool replenishes once per day after a long rest.

### Bonus Feat

A humanoid is generally a blank slate who has yet to truly specialize or tap into their true potential. At each level a humanoid gains an additional feat of any type; the humanoid must meet the prerequisites of these feats as normal.

### Vocational Training

At 2nd level, and every 2 levels thereafter the humanoid may select a single perform or profession skill. The humanoid gains a +2 class bonus on skill checks made with the selected skill, in addition the creature gains a single skill feat related to the chosen skill or skill focus; if they already possess all skills feats related to the chosen skill, they may instead treat their ranks in the selected skill as 2 higher for the purpose of determining the effects of feats or abilities dependent upon the creature’s ranks in the skill. The humanoid can select the same skill more than once using this ability to gain an additional skill feat related to that skill, but does not allow for stacking of the class bonus for the same skill.

### Untapped Potential

At 3rd level, the humanoid gains one of the following benefits:

- The humanoid may treat their strength as 4 higher for the purposes of determining their carrying capacity.
- The humanoid gains an additional 2 skill ranks per level of humanoid.
- The humanoid has begun basic combat training, gaining proficiency in a single simple or martial weapon he did not already possess. In addition the humanoid may select a single weapon he has proficiency with, he may treat his base attack bonus as 2 higher (though his BAB from humanoid levels cannot exceed his humanoid level) for all attacks, feats, or abilities that utilize the selected weapon.

### Generalist

At 5th level, a humanoid gains a +1 class bonus to all profession skill checks, in addition the humanoid may select one of the following benefits:

- The humanoid doubles his gold income from a perform check as long as his perform check meets or exceeds DC 20. In addition for every degree of success beyond this DC he gains an additional gold from his perform check. This ability only affects perform skills the humanoid selected with his Vocational Training class feature.
- When the humanoid succeeds at a profession skill check to craft he treats his profession check as 1 degree of success higher for the purposes of determining his progress at crafting the item. This ability only affects profession skills the humanoid selected with his Vocational Training class feature.
- When the humanoid makes a profession check for the laborer profession to earn a living, he doubles his gold income. In addition, when using a laborer profession check for a specific use, he may always take a 15 on the skill check; this is similar to taking a 10 on a skill check but treating the result of the check as if he had rolled 15. This ability only affects profession skills the humanoid selected with his Vocational Training class feature.
- The humanoid gains an additional feat that they qualify for as a bonus feat.
