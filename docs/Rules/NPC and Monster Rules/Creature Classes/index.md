title: Creature Classes
---
This page is to detail classes that exist for creatures and creature types. Rather than a class like Fighter or Wizard, creature classes are more restrictive on what type of creature can take them, or drastically alter a creature when taken.

Creature classes help define levels for a base creature, but assist with scaling a creature up. For example a creature gaining levels of vampire would incrementally gain powers rather than what would be equivalent to several levels of power all at once. This allows for better distinction of power rather than needing to add arbitrary hit dice, stats, or abilities to reflect the creatureâ€™s power.

Finally this system is to help make the monsters more compatible with character classes should GM decide to add a character class to a creature, as a goal of this system is to have more consistency overall.

List of Creature Classes:
