## Class Features

The following are class features of a zombie.

### Weapon and Armor Proficienc

A zombie gains no additional weapon or armor proficiencies.

### Undeath

When a living creature gains levels in an undead class they gain the undead type in addition to their previous creature type. Any features of the undead that conflict with the creature’s base type (such as being alive, requiring to eat/sleep/ect..) are overwritten by the undead type, but the creature retains their base type for the purposes of continuing to meet qualifications for their creature type (as long as those qualifications do not conflict with the undead type such as needing to be alive).

### Mystic Pool

A zombie learns to push their natural energies to create both the magical and extraordinary. This pool contains a number of points equal to his levels in zombie. A mystic pool may be used as a stamina or a spell point pool, though it does not stack with either when determining the size of either pool. Similar to a stamina and spell point pool, a mystic pool restores itself after a long rest.

At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter the mystic pool’s size increases by an additional 1. If they obtain a mystic pool from another class or source he may combine the pools and their levels to determine the total capacity of the mystic pool. If this is the character’s first level in a class their mystic pool’s capacity increases by an additional 2.

Unlike normal classes, creature classes do not count as either Martial or Casting classes for the purposes of determining MPB and SPB, and if this is their first level in a martial or magic class, despite having a mystic pool.

### Mindless Undead

This type of undead class is a mindless undead, gaining immunity to all mind-affecting and illusion type spells. This creature has no intelligence modifier, gaining minimum skill ranks per level. Skill ranks gained from this class while they remain mindless must be used in physical-based skills (strength, dex, constitution), except for concentration. In addition the creature cannot take levels in other classes until the creature gains an intelligence score; the creature retains all classes, feats, and class features from its time alive. Feats the undead would no longer qualify for due to lacking an intelligence score cease to function (as well as any feats using that feat as a prerequisite) until the undead regains the prerequisite intelligence again.

A mindless undead must retrain all skill ranks they possess if this adjustment in intelligence would cause them to no longer have enough skill ranks for the skills they already possess.

Due to this the undead recall none of their past life and function through a combination of instinct and whatever force returned them as an undead. A GM may declare an undead to remain intelligent rather than requiring a different ability to later regain it.

### Zombified

At 1st level, the zombie’s reanimated body is mostly intact but the partially decomposed state is both beneficial and detrimental to a zombie. A zombie gains DR 5/Slashing, Resist 2 against Cold, Wind, and Nature elements, but gains Weakness to Fire. All speeds the zombie possessed while alive are reduced by half (minimum 5 feet) and they receive a permanent -2 penalty to their dexterity score. At 3rd level the zombie’s resistance improves to Resist 3, and their DR improves to DR 10/Slashing.

The zombie gains a bite natural weapon attack that deals 1d2 damage. If the zombie’s base creature already possessed a bite attack, their existing bite attack instead gains a +2 bonus to all damage rolls.

The zombie’s body stops decaying as the magic reanimating it allows it to remain preserved, but does not reverse any decay that may have occurred before the corpse was reanimated.

### Zombie Trait

At 1st level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the zombie gains one of the following traits as the magic reanimating them pushes their body further.

- **Fast Zombie**: The zombie’s penalty to speed is reduced by 5 feet, at 3rd level the zombie’s penalty to speed is completely negated. At 3rd level the zombie gains a +5 bonus to all speeds they possess.
- **Hardened Flesh**: The zombie gains toughness as a bonus feat, if the zombie already possesses this feat or later gains it, they instead gain an additional 2 hit points per level of zombie. The zombie may select this trait more than once.
- **Infectious**(Human subtype only): Creatures hit by the zombie’s unarmed strikes or natural weapons are subject to the Zombie Plague disease (save of 1d20+ ½ the zombie’s hit dice + the levels in undead classes the zombie possesses). If the zombie slays a creature of the Human subtype with an unarmed strike or natural weapon, the disease instead automatically takes effect (unless the creature would be immune to diseases), raising as a zombie 2d4 minute later (gaining a level in the zombie class).
- **Highly Infectious**(Requires Infectious): Creatures bitten by the zombie are subject to a fortitude save attack (1d20 + ½ the zombie’s Hit dice + the zombies Charisma Modifier), a successful save attack infects the creature with Zombie Rot.
- **Powerful Bite**: The zombie’s bite attack’s damage dice improves by one step. This trait may be selected up to two times.

### Zombie Strength

At 2nd level, without the normal limiters, such as a lack of pain, the zombie’s reanimated body is capable of greater feats of strength than when it was alive. A zombie may ignore a number of points of hardness an object possesses when performing a sunder combat maneuver equal to half their charisma modifier, to a maximum of their zombie level. At 3rd level this bonus is no longer limited by the zombie’s level.

In addition, the zombie gains a +2 class bonus to their strength ability score, at 3rd level this bonus improves to +4.

### Undead Durability

At 2nd level, the undead creature gains a +1 bonus to their natural armor. Your existing bonus natural armor bonus increases by 1 every 5 levels of undead creature classes the creature possesses.

### Zombie Mutation

At 3rd level, the zombie’s body begins to mutate due the foul magic empowering it.

Then zombie selects one of the following abilities:

- **Acid Spit**: The zombie gains the ability to shoot acidic bile, dealing 3d6 + the zombie’s charisma modifier earth damage. This zombie may use this ability as a standard action by spending a mystic pool point to make a ranged touch attack with a maximum range of 60 feet. The zombie may choose to use this ability as a 30 foot cone instead, making a reflex save attack against each creature within the area (1d20 + ½ the zombie’s hit dice + the zombie’s charisma modifier), but doing so increases the delay between uses to 1d4+1 rounds.
- **Feral Zombie**: The zombie’s form becomes more bestial in appearance, granting the zombie a pair of claw attacks dealing 1d6 damage each. In addition the zombie’s legs become more powerful and capable of making great jumps allowing the zombie to add their charisma modifier to all Athletics checks made to jump.
- **Hulking Zombie**: The zombie’s muscles and upper body grow grotesque proportions. The zombie’s size increases by one step, but only natural weapons attached to the zombie’s arms, or unarmed strikes with the creature’s arms, improve their damage by one step; the zombie’s bite attack or other natural weapons do not increase in size. The zombie may wield weapons with their hands as a creature of their new size, but weapons not wielded by their hands treat the zombie as if they were one size category smaller for the purposes of wielding them. The zombie’s class bonus to strength is increased by an additional 2.
