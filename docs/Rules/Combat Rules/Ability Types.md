Special abilities and class features usually have an associated type between Supernatural or Extraordinary. These determine any potential restrictions such as anti-magic affecting them or not.

## Supernatural Abilities (Su)

Supernatural abilities are abilities that are magical or pull from an outside force. While these abilities do not require concentration to use they do not function within areas where magic is suppressed or negated, but are not subject to spell resistance. Â 

## Extraordinary Abilities (Ex)

Extraordinary abilities are non-magical in nature, but allow a creature to perform great feats within or beyond the limits of the mundane. These abilities usually do not require concentration nor are they affected by anything that would suppress or negate magical effects.
