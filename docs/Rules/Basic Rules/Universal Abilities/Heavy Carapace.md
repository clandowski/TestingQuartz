A creature doubles its existing natural armor when it gains this ability; this does not include enhancement bonuses to natural armor. The creature gains no agility bonus to AC similar to a creature wearing heavy armor. Crossbow and Firearm keyword weapons treat the creatureâ€™s natural armor as armor for the purpose of bypassing it.
