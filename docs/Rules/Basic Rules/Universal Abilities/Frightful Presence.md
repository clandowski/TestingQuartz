A creature with this ability becomes unsettling to their foes. When making an attack or using a combat maneuver, hostile creatures within the area of this ability (30 feet unless otherwise specified) that can see the creature are subject to a Mental save attack (1d20+Â½ HD + Psy mod usually). This only affects hostile creatures with less Hit Dice than the creature with this ability. A successful save attack causes affected creatures to become shaken for 1 minute; if you succeed by two degrees or more against the target they are instead panicked for 2d4 rounds and then shaken for 1 minute thereafter. Frightful presence is a mind-affecting fear effect.
