Some creatures have the ability to engulf creatures in their path as part of a 3 AP action. Unless otherwise specified the creature cannot make any other attacks in a round in which it uses the engulf ability. When using engulf the creature simply moves over its opponents, affecting as many as it can cover given its size; this is usually any squares the creature occupies that are also occupied by targets of their size or smaller.

The creature using the engulf makes a Physical(Agi) save attack against the creatures targeted. The targeted creatures may make an attack of opportunity against the engulfing creature, but if they do so they do not receive a save against this attack. A failed save attack pushes the targets back or aside (target’s choice) as the creature moves forward, while a successful save attack engulfs the target.

Once engulfed the creature is treated as if it was swallowed as per the swallow whole universal ability, granting them the pinned condition. In addition to the usual effects of swallow whole the creature is in danger of suffocating, as well as may be subject to other effects (such as a paralysis effect or similar). A creature cutting their way out of an engulfing creature needs to only deal damage equaling ⅓ the creature’s hit points rather than ½ to cut their way out, but leaves no hole in the creature as it closes up moments after they escape.
