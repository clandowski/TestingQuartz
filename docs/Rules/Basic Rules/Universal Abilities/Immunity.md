Creatures with an immunity take no damage or are otherwise not affected by the listed source(s); which can range from elemental types, damage types, or even conditions. When a creature has an elemental immunity it generally means they only have immunity to the damage of that type of spell, but not immunity from spells with that affinity; a creature with light immunity would ignore light damage, but wouldn't become immune to a light affinity cure spell.
