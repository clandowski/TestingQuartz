Creatures with the scent ability allow them to use their heightened sense of smell to detect other creatures. Unless otherwise specified creatures can detect other creatures within 30 feet by just their sense of smell. If upwind this range increases is doubled, while if downwind this range is halved. In wind tiers above 2 these ranges increase by an additional 5 feet if upwind, or reduced by 5 feet (minimum 5 feet) if downwind for each tier above 2. Overpowering scents, such as a skunkâ€™s musk, can be detected at triple normal range.

Scent does not allow a creature to determine the exact source unless the creature is within 5 feet of the source. In addition, a creature with scent receives a +10 bonus to track creatures while the trail is fresh, reducing by 2 for each hour the trail remains (minimum 0).
