Blood Drain allows a creature to consume or otherwise drain the blood of their victim as part of an attack. Blood drain designates a natural weapon or some other source the creature uses to perform the blood drain. When using the designated natural weapon the creature does an additional damage equal to the damage die of the natural weapon used; and gains a number of temporary hit points equal to this additional damage; these temporary hit points may stack with themselves but expire at the creature’s next turn. Some effects may further increase the damage caused by blood drain. In addition a creature targeted by blood drain is subject to a Resilience(End) save attack (1d20 + ½ the draining creature’s hit dice + Endurance modifier); with a successful save attack dealing an additional 1d4 points of Endurance damage and granting additional temporary hit points equal to twice the Endurance damage inflicted. Enhancement bonuses to the natural weapon used in the blood drain may apply to the save attack of this ability.
