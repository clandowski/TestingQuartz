An aspect of the creature is unnatural or unsettling causing animals to become wary of approaching. Creatures with animal intelligence (a score of 2 or lower) are subject to a Mental save attack when entering this aura. Unless otherwise specified this save attack is made at (1d20 + Â½ Hit Dice + Psyche modifier). A successful save attack causes the affected creature to become shaken and become unable to approach the target creature for 1d4+1 rounds. A failed save attack leaves the creature unaffected and cannot affect them again for 24 hours.
