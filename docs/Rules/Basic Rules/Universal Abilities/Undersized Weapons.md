The creature uses manufactured weapons as if it were one size category Smaller than the creature’s actual size. In addition unarmed strikes and natural weapons made with limbs capable of holding weapons (usually hands) are made as a creature one size category smaller. Undersized weapons have the “short” or “long” tag, to indicate reach. Short indicates the creature’s body does not grant them the reach of their size, and instead have the reach of a creature a size category smaller (for both weapons, unarmed strikes, and natural weapons); while long indicates the creature wields smaller weapons, but has the reach of a creature of their size.
