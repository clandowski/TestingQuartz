Creatures with Dimvision can see in normal and dim light conditions without penalty up to a specified distance. Creatures with Dimvision and Darkvision apply their dim light range in addition to their darkvision range to determine the total distance they can see in dim light conditions.

Multiple sources of Dimvision may stack, but only add half of the lower of the two values to the higher Dim Light distance.
