A creature with a glide speed allows them to fall without taking damage as long as the creature continues to glide. When gliding the creature slowly descends at a rate of 5 feet per round. In addition the creature may move up to their glide speed as part of a single movement. The creature may take a run action when gliding but doing so increases the rate that the creature descends to 15 feet per round. Glide checks require acrobatics checks, similar to flying. If a gliding creature does not move at least half their glide speed each round they must make the usual acrobatics checks to remain gliding, or a acrobatics check to hover; each of these acrobatics checks have their DCs reduced by 5. If the creature is attacked while gliding they must still make a DC 10 acrobatics check to avoid losing an additional 10 feet of altitude.

If a creature possesses a fly speed they may always choose to glide instead of fly at a glide speed of half their fly speed.
