Creatures with blindsense are capable of noticing things they would normally be unable to see. A creature with blindsense, unless otherwise specified, can automatically pinpoint the location of a creature within range of its blindsense ability, provided it still has line of effect to it. If the creature would otherwise be unable to see the creature they still suffer the penalties for attacking or being attacked by a creature invisible to them (such as treating them as having total concealment). A creature with blindsense is able to move normally even if blinded.
