Blindsight is similar to blindsense, but is not only able to locate invisible creatures, but treats them as if they were visible to the creature with blindsight. Unless otherwise specified blindsight ignores most kinds of concealment, and otherwise can see as well as a creature using their normal senses, within the listed range of their blindsight.
