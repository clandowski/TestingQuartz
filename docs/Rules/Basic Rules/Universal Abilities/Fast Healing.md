The fast healing ability allows the creature to regain hit points each round automatically. Unless otherwise specified, fast healing is treated like natural healing, and thus cannot restore hit points caused by starvation, thirst or suffocation, nor does it allow a creature to regrow or reattach lost body parts. A creature with fast healing receives the noted amount of healing at the start of their turn each round. Fast healing is normally an extraordinary ability, but if granted through spells or other such effects may instead be magical in nature depending on the source that granted it.
