Creatures with a climb speed gain a +8 racial bonus to all Climb checks, and arenâ€™t flat-footed while climbing. A creature with a climb speed can simply choose to take a 10 while climbing even while threatened.

Creatures with a climb speed can use the accelerated climb ability (making a climb check at a -5 penalty), but instead moves at double their climb speed, but cannot move faster than their base land speed. Unless otherwise specified a creature with a climb speed still cannot perform a charge or run action while they remain climbing.
