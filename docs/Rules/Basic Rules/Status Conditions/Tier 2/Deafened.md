**Type**: Tier 2

A creature with the deafened condition cannot hear. All sound-based Perception checks automatically fail. The creature gains a 20% spell failure chance when casting spells unless they are affected by the Silent Spell meta talent or make the Concentration check to cast without a verbal component. Illusions based on sound automatically fail against a deafened creature, and the deafened creature takes only half damage from sources dealing sonic type damage.
