**Type**: Tier 2

A creature with the blinded conduction is unable to see. All sight-based perception checks, skill, or activities dependent upon vision automatically fail (such as reading). The creature is unaffected by vision-based illusions, though other illusions that can interact with a creature (such as through touch or sound) are unaffected. All gaze attacks automatically fail against the creature. The blinded creature treats all opponents as invisible. A blinded creature must make a DC 10 Acrobatics skill check if they move more than half their speed in a single movement; failing this check causes the creature to fall prone. If the afflicted creature possesses blindsense, blindsight, or tremorsense they do not need to make the acrobatics check to move; in addition these senses provide the usual benefits to a creature attempting to fight invisible creatures.

A creature may always choose to close their eyes as a free action to temporarily grant themselves the blinded condition.
