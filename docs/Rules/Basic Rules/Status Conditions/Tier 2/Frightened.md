**Type**: Tier 2

A creature with the frightened condition automatically flees from the source of the fear effect to the best of its ability. The creature can use abilities and spells to flee; and must do so if they would otherwise be unable to escape. If for some reason the affected creature would be unable to flee it may attempt to fight, but takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, save attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. Frightened is a more severe version of shaken, but a less severe form of panicked. Unless stated otherwise creatures who are already shaken and would become shaken again instead become frightened; if a creature is shaken but would be targeted by the frightened or panicked condition, only take that effect rather than stacking immediately into a more severe effect.
