**Type**: Tier 2

A creatureÂ  with the fascinated condition is entranced, unable to take actions other than devote their attention to the object of this fascination, for the duration of the effect. The creature takes a -4 penalty on all perception and sense motive checks; though if the creature is in danger, such as a hostile creature approaching, they receive a new saving throw against the effect. Obvious threats, such as a creature drawing or readying a weapon, or casting a spell, immediately ends the effect. A creature may also attempt to end the fascinated condition on another creature by using a 3 AP action to break their concentration on the object.
