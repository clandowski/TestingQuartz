**Type**: Tier 2

A creature with the exhausted condition moves at half speed and cannot take the run or charge action. In addition the creature suffers a -3 penalty to their strength and Agility modifiers. A creature can reduce the exhausted condition to fatigued after 1 hour of rest. Exhausted is a more severe version of fatigue, and unless otherwise specified when a fatigued character does something or is affected by something that would cause fatigue, they instead become exhausted.
