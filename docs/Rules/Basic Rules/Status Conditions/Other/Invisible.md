**Type**: N/A

A creature who is invisible gains a +2 bonus to attack rolls against creatures who cannot see them, unless they have some sort of vision that would allow them to view their attacker (such as blindsight). In addition creatures unable to see an invisible foe are Flat-Footed against attacks from an invisible creature. Finally invisible creatures are treated as having total concealment (50% miss chance) against attacks originally from a creature who cannot see them.
