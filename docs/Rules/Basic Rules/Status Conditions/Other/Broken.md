**Type**: N/A

Broken is a condition applied to objects rather than creatures. An object is broken once its hit points have been reduced to below half.

The broken condition has different effect depending on the object its affecting.

- Weapons: Broken weapons suffer a -2 penalty on all attack and damage rolls, and have their critical threat range and multiplier reduced to 20 and x2.
- Armor and Shields reduce their granted AC bonus by half (rounded down).
- Other objects that donâ€™t fit into these columns may not have immediate noticeable effects, but otherwise are reduced in value to 50% their normal value.
