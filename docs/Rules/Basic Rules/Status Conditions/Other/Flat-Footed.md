**Type**: N/A

A creature who is flat-footed loses their Agility bonus and dodge bonuses to AC, and is unable to use reactions. Creatures who have yet to act in combat are flat-footed, though some abilities or effects (such as feint) may also cause a creature to become flat-footed. Creatures with a Agility modifier penalty, as if having a low Agility score, do not lose this penalty to AC.
