**Type**: N/A

A creature that has successfully stabilized either through their own effort, or outside assistance, is no longer dying, but is still at negative hit points. Creatures who are stable no longer need to make checks to stabilize and no longer lose hit points each round. A stable creature who takes damage after becoming stable resumes dying and must attempt to become stable again. (See combat rules for more information).
