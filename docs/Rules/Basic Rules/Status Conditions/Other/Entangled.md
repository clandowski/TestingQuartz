**Type**: N/A

A creature who becomes entangled has their movement impeded. Unless otherwise specified a creature can still move, but only at half speed, unable to run or charge. An entangled creature takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, and a -4 penalty to Agility. Creatures who are entangled find it more difficult to cast spells and must make a concentration check (DC 15 + Â½ BCB of the spell being cast), or lose the spell.
