**Type**: N/A

A creature that is dead is treated as an object. Normal and magical healing, including those that can repair objects, do not restore a creature from the dead; some magics may allow for the restoration from the dead. Dead bodies decay as normal, though some magic may be used to preserve the body. Creatures resurrected usually do not need to worry about any ill effects from being dead.
