**Type**: N/A

A creature who becomes prone on the ground takes a -4 penalty to attack rolls, Physical(Agi) saving throws, and becomes unable to use bow keyword ranged weapons to make attacks with. Prone defenders gain a +4 bonus to AC against ranged attacks, but take a -4 penalty to AC against melee attacks. Standing up from prone requires a 2 AP action, and provokes attacks of opportunity.
