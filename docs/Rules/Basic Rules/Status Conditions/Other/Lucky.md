**Type**: N/A

A creature which is Lucky may roll an additional d20 and take the better result. A lucky creature may take a 10 on skill checks, and uses half as much time to take a 20 (this only counts as 1 roll if the duration of the effect is a number of rolls). The source of this condition will specify which rolls it may apply to (such as only melee attack rolls or only saving throws) and the duration of the effect, which may be specified by time, number of uses, or both. If the source does not specify what type of roll the condition applies to, it may apply to any d20 roll. If the source does not specify the duration of the effect, it applies to a single roll (usually the next roll that it could apply to).

If the source of this condition grants Lucky 2, Lucky 3, etc. the condition allows the creature to roll 2 additional d20s (for a total of 3) or 3 additional d20s (for a total of 4), etc. and to take the best result.
