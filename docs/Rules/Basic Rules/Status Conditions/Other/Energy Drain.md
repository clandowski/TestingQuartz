**Type**: N/A

A creature is afflicted with energy drain when they gain one or more negative levels. If the affected creature has negative levels equal or greater than their number of hit dice they automatically die.

## Negative Levels

A creature with negative levels either through energy drain or other sources. For each negative level a creature possesses, it takes a stacking -1 penalty on all d20 rolls, and has their current and maximum hit points reduced by 5 for each negative level. The creature is also treated as one level lower, for each negative level, for the purpose of determining the creatureâ€™s MPB, SPB, and BCB. If the affected creature has negative levels equal or greater than their number of hit dice they automatically die. Some negative levels may not be permanent, but rather are marked as temporary, allowing for a new saving throw each day, though some effects may designate temporary negative levels to become permanent after a certain timeframe has passed.
