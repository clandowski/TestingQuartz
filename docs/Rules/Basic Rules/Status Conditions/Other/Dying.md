**Type**: N/A

A creature who is dying is unconscious and is at risk of death. Dying creatures are creatures at negative hit points and have not stabilized yet. Dying creatures can take no actions, but at the beginning of their turn must make a Tenacity check to stabilize (see combat rules for more information).
