**Type**: N/A

Creatures with ability damage have their ability score reduced by the listed amount, imparting a penalty to the ability score. Should this be enough to change the modifier from the ability score the creature should recalculate anything affected by the ability score modifier (such as attack and damage rolls from strength, or current and maximum hit points from Endurance). Ability damage heals naturally at a rate of 1 point of ability damage per day per ability score affected.

Ability damage can bring an attribute below 0, further increasing the penalty by an additional -1 for each odd numbered negative value it is at (0 = -5, -1 = -6, -3 = -7, etc).

In addition the following effects should occur when a creatureâ€™s individual attributes reach 0 or lower:

- A creature at 0 strength has a heavy load of 0, meaning if they are carrying nothing they can move at a heavy load; but anything below 0 causes the creature to instead become unable to move and helpless.
- A creature at 0 or lower Agility gains no additional penalties beyond the modifier penalty.
- A creature at 0 or lower Endurance is permanently exhausted until their Endurance is raised above 0. If their Endurance modifier would become low enough to reduce their maximum hit points to 0 or lower the creature instantly dies.
- A creature at 0 or lower intelligence permanently gains the madness condition until their intelligence is raised above 0.
- A creature at 0 or lower Focus permanently gains the disoriented condition until their Focus is raised above 0.
- A creature at 0 or lower Psyche becomes unable to resist the commands of others and will automatically follow the last command given to them to the best of their ability. This effect lasts until their Psyche is raised above 0.
