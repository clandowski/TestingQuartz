**Type**: N/A

A creature with the disabled condition receives 2 less AP during their turn, but may take free actions and reactions as normal. In addition a disbaled character moves at half speed. A creature is normally disabled when they are at 0 hit points and using a 3 AP or greater action deals 1 point of damage after the completion of the act, which may cause a creature to go to negative hit points and begin dying.
