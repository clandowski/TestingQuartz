**Type**: N/A

Creatures with the pinned condition cannot move, are Flat-Footed and are automatically prone (taking penalties as normal). A pinned creature can only attempt to free itself (usually using a CMB check or Escape Artist check). Pinned creatures are still able to speak and perform purely mental actions as normal, but are otherwise unable to cast spells unless they are modified by the Still Spell meta talent. Pinned creatures must make a concentration check as if they are grappled to cast. Pinned is a more severe version of grappled and thus the effects do not stack.
