**Type**: N/A

A creature who is helpless is treated as having a Agility of 0 (-5 modifier), and all melee attacks against a helpless target gain a +4 bonus (same bonus as attacking a prone target). Creatures are usually helpless when paralyzed, bound, unconscious, or other similar effects. Finally, a helpless creature is susceptible to coup de grace attacks.
