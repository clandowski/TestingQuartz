**Type**: N/A

A creature with the grappled condition is unable to move and takes a -4 penalty to Agility, and a -2 penalty on all attack rolls except those made to grapple or escape a grapple. A grappled creature cannot perform actions that would require two hands to perform. Grappled spellcasters must make concentration checks to cast spells; DC is The grappler’s last MSB check used to establish or maintain the grapple + the BCB of the spell you’re casting, or lose the spell. See the Concentration skill for more information.

Finally, grappled creatures are unable to use stealth to hide as long as another creature is grappling them, though they receive a +2 bonus to their CMD if they are invisible to the creature that is attempting to grapple them.
