**Type**: Tier 1

Creatures that are fatigued are unable to take the run or charge action. In addition the creature surfers a temporary -2 penalty to their Strength and Agility ability scores while they remain fatigued. Unless otherwise specified if the creature performs a task, or is afflicted by an ability, that would cause them to become fatigued while they already are fatigued, they instead become exhausted. Unless otherwise specified a creature is fatigued until they take a long rest.
