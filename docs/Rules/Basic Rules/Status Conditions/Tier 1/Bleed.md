**Type:** Tier 1

Creatures afflicted with bleed take bleed damage at the beginning of their turn. The amount of damage caused by the bleed is dependent upon the ability that applied it; if the ability lists a dice, the value is rolled at the start of each turn. Unless otherwise specified bleed effects only last 1d4 rounds plus an additional round per 5 base attack bonus of the creature that applied it.

Bleeding can be removed through a Medic check (Usually DC 10+½ Base attack bonus + the higher strength or Agility modifiers of the attacker) or through the application of any spell or ability that cures at least 5 + the base attack bonus of the attacker, hit points of damage.

Unless otherwise specified bleed effects do not stack with themselves, but may stack from different sources. Applications of the same source of bleed only rests the duration of the bleed. If an effect from the same source would deal a worse form of bleed (such as a spell dealing more bleed when a spell point is spent) the duration is reset and the worse bleed effect is used instead.
