**Type**: Tier 1

Shaken creatures cannot willingly approach the source of this fear effect unless they pass a Mental save against 10 + the bonus of the save attack or demoralize check that caused the shaken condition. If the shaken condition was applied without a save the DC instead becomes 10 + ½ the hit dice of the source + the source’s Psyche modifier. The creature does not need to pass this save if they cannot see or otherwise locate the source.

In addition, while within 30 feet of the source of this fear effect, and has line of sight the creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, save attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. Creatures immune to mind-affecting abilities are generally immune to the shaken status.
