**Type:**Â Tier 1

Creatures that are disoriented must roll randomly to determine the direction of their voluntary movement (including a 5-foot step). The movement must continue for at least 10 feet in that direction (except in the case of a 5-foot step) before the creature may choose to end the movement, forgoing any unused movement remaining. A creature under this effect may instead spend 5 AP to move up to half its speed without rolling to determine a random direction.
