**Type**: Tier 3

The panicked condition is identical to the frightened condition, except the affected creature must also immediately drop anything it is currently holding when it begins to flee. In addition if the creature is unable to flee, they cannot attack and must instead use their actions to perform the total defense or some other action that would assist in hiding or protecting themselves.
