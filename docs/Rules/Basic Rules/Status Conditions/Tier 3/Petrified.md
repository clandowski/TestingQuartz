**Type**: Tier 3

A creature with the petrified condition is turned to stone and treated as if they are unconscious. If the petrified creatureâ€™s stone form is broken, the creature may remain unharmed if the broken pieces are returned before they are returned to their normal state; if the pieces are not returned then the creature suffers the appropriate hit point loss or debilitation associated with the lost parts.
