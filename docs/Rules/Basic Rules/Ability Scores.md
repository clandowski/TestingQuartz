## Calculating Ability Scores

Ability scores are assumed to start at 10 for a creature, with 10 being a "average" ability. Anything above this shows the character having greater prowess while anything below this represents detriment in this score.

First when generating ability scores the GM should choose a method of determining your six starting attributes, generally chosen between Point Buy, Rolled, or Stat Array. See the [[../../Character Creation|Character Creation]] page, for more information on these types. Once the base ability scores have been decided a creature's race usually will give additional bonuses or penalties to their ability scores.

Primarily ability scores are done via point-buy doing a 20-point system. Spending points to raise an ability above 10, and gaining points for reducing a score below 10. With this system scores cannot go above 18 or below 7. Below is a table detailing the point-cost of an individual score.

|Score|Total Points|
|---|---|
|7|-4|
|8|-2|
|9|-1|
|10|0|
|11|1|
|12|2|
|13|3|
|14|5|
|15|7|
|16|10|
|17|13|
|18|17|

## Ability Score Advancement

At each level (including 1st) a character may allocate points into their ability scores as an inherent  bonus to represent their continued growth as a character. A character gains a point each level to add to his ability scores, as well as an additional point every even level, as an inherent bonus to his stats. This means a character at 1st level will have 1 point, while a character will have 30 points to allocate at level 20. A single ability score cannot have an inherent bonus to a single ability score for more than half the character's hit dice (rounded up).

With this a character's ability scores slowly advance as they level. Usually only temporary magic effects can further enhance a creature's ability scores.

## Ability Score Modifiers

An ability score modifier is the value taken from an ability score. Rather than using the stat as-is a modifier is derived from this value to determine the bonus or penalty from that stat. Almost every stat or action involves an ability score modifier in some way, from attacks to skills.

The formula to determine an ability score's modifier is (Ability Score - 10) / 2. Universally always rounding to a lower number will then give you the resulting ability score. The reason is 10 is considered the base starting point of a 0 modifier, making values below 10 granting a negative modifier, while values 12 and above granting a positive; with 11 also granting a 0

Below is a set of example ability scores and the expected modifiers you would have:

|Ability Score|Modifier|
|---|---|
|0|-5|
|1|-5|
|2|-4|
|3|-4|
|4|-3|
|5|-3|
|6|-2|
