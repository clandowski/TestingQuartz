This section details the types of bonuses and if they stack. As a general rule, if a bonus type does not stack, but a creature is currently benefiting from multiple of the same type of bonus only the highest bonus type may apply.

Penalties are generally not typed and unless otherwise specified can stack with each other. If a penalty is typed it can stack with any bonuses of the same type potentially lowering or outright negating the typed bonus, but cannot stack with other penalties of the same type, taking the worst penalty of the same type.


|Bonus Type|Description|Stacks?|
|---|---|---|
|Alchemical|An alchemical bonus is granted by the use of an alchemical substance.|No|
|Armor|An armor bonus applies to AC checks and is granted by armor or by a magical effect that mimics armor. Armor bonuses stack with all other bonuses to armor class (even with natural armor bonuses) except other armor bonuses. An armor bonus does not apply to touch AC checks.|No|
|Circumstance|A circumstance bonus is usually a bonus granted from conditional factors that may improve or hinder the success of a task. Circumstance bonuses stack with other circumstance bonuses, unless they are from the same source.|Yes|
|Competence|A competence bonus represents a boon to a creature’s ability to perform a task. Competence bonuses do not stack with other competence bonuses.|No|
|Deflection|A deflection bonus affects armor checks. Deflection bonuses stack with all other bonuses to AC except other deflection bonuses. A deflection bonus applies to touch AC checks.|No|
|Deific|A deific bonus is usually from patron sources, usually a boon from a deity. Deific bonuses on the same character do not stack.|No|
|Dodge|A dodge bonus improves armor checks. Anytime a character is Flat-Footed, they also lose any dodge bonuses the character may have. Dodge bonuses stack with all other bonuses to AC, even other dodge bonuses. Dodge bonuses apply to touch AC checks.|Yes|
|Enhancement|An enhancement bonus can be a bonus to armor, shields, natural armor, weapons, or even ability scores. Multiple enhancement bonuses on the same object do not stack. But a creature may have an enhancement bonus to their armor, an enhancement bonus to their shield, and an enhancement bonus to their natural armor at the same time, allowing the effects to stack as the enhancement bonus targets a different item/bonus.<br><br>Since enhancement bonuses to armor or natural armor effectively increase the armor or natural armor’s bonus to AC, they don’t apply against touch attacks.|No|
|Feat|A feat bonus is a type of bonus granted by a feat; not all feats apply a feat bonus, but generally feat bonuses will only come from feats. These are bonuses that are meant to stack with other non-feat sources while ensuring certain feats cannot stack with each other.|No|
|Inherent|Inherent bonuses normally only come from the progression of a character as they level up. While inherent bonuses do not stack, the process of a character leveling up treats it as the bonus itself increasing rather than a series of stacking inherent bonuses.|No|
|Insight|An insight bonus goes beyond that of a competence bonus, granting a character nearly precognitive knowledge to help assist in their task. Multiple insight bonuses do not stack.|No|
|Luck|A luck bonus represents a creature’s luck and fortune. Multiple luck bonuses do not stack.|No|
|Morale|A morale bonus represents a boon to the emotional state of a creature, granting them additional determination in combat. Multiple morale bonuses do not stack. Creatures that lack an intelligence score cannot benefit from morale bonuses.|No|
|Natural Armor|A natural armor bonus applies to AC checks and is representative of the hardiness and naturally tough body of a creature. Natural armor bonuses stack with all other bonuses to armor class except other natural armor bonuses. Some effects may grant an enhancement bonus to the creature’s existing natural armor bonus, which has the effect of increasing the natural armor’s overall bonus to armor class but in itself is not a natural armor bonus. A natural armor bonus doesn’t apply against touch attacks.<br><br>Creatures without a natural armor bonus listed are still treated as having a natural armor bonus of 0 for the purposes of effects that provide an increase to existing natural armor.|No|
|Racial|A racial bonus is a bonus granted by the creature’s type, either physical or mental, usually a bonus to an ability score or a skill. If a creature’s race changes for some reason it loses all racial bonuses it had in its previous form.|No|
|Resistance|A resistance bonus is a bonus that primarily affects saving throws. Multiple resistance bonuses do not stack.|No|
|Shield|A shield bonus  applies to AC checks and is granted by a shield or by a magical effect that mimics a shield. Shield bonuses stack with all other bonuses to AC except other shield bonuses. Like armor a shield can be enhanced further improving its shield bonus. A shield bonus doesn’t apply to touch AC checks.|No|
|Size|A size bonus is a representation of bonuses granted by a creature’s size category, usually applying to AC, attacks, stealth, strength score, and Agility score. Size bonuses do not stack.|No|
