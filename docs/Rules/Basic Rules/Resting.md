Sometimes between combats and days of adventuring a creature may spend time to rest and recover their resources. Resting has three variants each with their own benefits and time required for short, long, and full rests.

## Short rest

You must rest for 5 minutes; you do not need to sleep, but you canâ€™t exert yourself (for example run, perform non-mental skill check, or enter another combat in this time). If performing a task during a short rest (such as applying an armor repair kit during a short rest) you cannot perform additional tasks such as these during this short rest, and must take an additional short rest to perform these additional tasks. For martial characters this will allow the restoration of some abilities usable with stamina, or allow a character to perform the run action again without penalty.

## Long Rest

A long rest requires a character to sleep for 8 hours, this does not need to be entirely consecutive, such as creatures taking watch over the course of a night, but cannot be broken into smaller segments than at least 2 hours of rest at a time. Once the total rest has been achieved a creature regains hit points equal to their character level and regains their daily resources, such as stamina, spell points, mystic pool, or other abilities requiring a long rest. A creature taking a long rest also gains the benefits of a short rest.

## Full Rest

A long rest requires an uninterrupted 24 hours of rest or leisurely activity. During this time a creature cannot exert themselves through combat, spellcasting, or other similar activities. This is usually achieved through downtime in a town or outpost as a form of long-term rest rather than the minimum required rest most adventurers take while adventuring through the day. After a full rest a creature restores hit points up to their maximum resources, and all ability damage is removed. A creature taking a full rest gains the benefits of a long and short rest in addition to the full rest.
