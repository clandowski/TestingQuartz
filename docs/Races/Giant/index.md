## Description

**Physical Description**: Giants are a primeval race of enormous humanoids which can vary in appearance as much as any of the myriad humanoid races. Their strong connection to the natural world influences giants more than most races, and tribes that have settled in one area for many generations tend to take on the physical characteristics of the land around them. Giants stand twice as tall as most humanoids, with most examples somewhere between 10 to 13 feet tall and weighing upwards of 1,000 lbs.

**Society**: While most giants are territorial and tribal, tending to live in secluded settlements led by a chieftain or shaman, the natural ability of giants to adapt to their surroundings has allowed some tribes to instead live alongside or intermingle with the ever-expanding human kingdoms; although most tend to find life in a human-sized city inconvenient at best and inhospitable at worst. Nomadic tribes often take up professions as traveling merchants, using their prodigious size and strength to carry an entire caravanâ€™s supply on their backs while making an intimidating target for highwaymen and bandits.

**Relations**: Giants are seldom in a hurry and move at their own pace, and can find the industriousness and hunger for advancement of the human race to be a bit grating. In contrast, they often find the whimsical and aloof nature of halflings amusing and many giant settlements welcome halflings for the lust for life that they bring and their tiny, dexterous hands. Giants tend to be at odds with dwarves and elves, as the long-lived races are sometimes in conflict over territorial borders.

**Type**: Humanoid(Giant)
