## Description

**Physical Description**: Planesborn have the baseline image and build of a human, but tend to vary greatly based on their heritage. Planesborn are generally the offspring of humans and extraplanar beings, though they sometimes can involve other races. The most common form of these races are the elemental born races (Cragborn, Undine, Ifrit, or Sylph) as the world tends to naturally intersect with these planes are various points. Though races of Nephilim and Cambion (Angels and Demon offspring) do also exist. Each race’s appearance is greatly influenced by their elemental heritage to the point they usually display very little traits of their mortal parents.

**Society**: Planesborn can be found rarely within society, though may also build societies near leylines, usually due to some innate calling and sense of ease when near them. Otherwise their numbers tend to be too few to truly make a society of their own, instead growing up within human settlements.

Most planesborn come from single parent households as most elementals do not exist within the realm long enough to even witness the birth of the child, usually meaning the human in the relationship is the mother. There do exist exceptions to this as some planesborn are the result of magical rituals, or the extraplanar beings are more permanently bound to the world by a powerful caster.

**Relations**: The elemental born plansborn are usually tolerated, if seen as somewhat strange, but most societies aren’t immediately hostile to their presence. The Nephilim are usually looked upon with reverence, being the offspring of angelic beings, while the Cambion tend to live much more difficult lives, due to their demonic heritage

Most races outside of casters tend to never have much interest in the small societies the planesborn build near ley lines usually due to the locations never directly being places of great material resources.

**Type**: Humanoid(Planesborne)
