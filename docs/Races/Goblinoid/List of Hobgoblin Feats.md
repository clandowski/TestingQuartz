If successful you may roll damage as if performing a sunder against an unattended object, adding in any damage bonuses as usual, though for the purpose of this roll treat the hardness of the trap as 5. If the damage is at least half the trap’s Disable Device DC the trap is disabled, but damage lower than half the DC causes the trap to instead activate. You can only attempt this on non-magical traps. You must be able to reach some part of the trap with your attack in order to use this feat. At the GM’s discretion, some traps may not be susceptible to this feat.<br></p></span></p><h3><span><p dir="auto">Vicious Loner (Race)</p></span></h3><p><span><p dir="auto"><b>Prerequisite</b>:    Goblinoid(Any)<br></p></span></p><p><span><p dir="auto"><b>Benefit</b>:    Whenever you reduce a foe to 0 hit points or fewer you gain temporary hit points equal to 2 + your Endurance modifier (minimum 1) until the end of your next turn.
