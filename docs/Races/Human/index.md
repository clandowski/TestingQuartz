## Description

**Physical Description**: Human physical characteristics are generally varied in both facial structure, skin tone, and other features. Generally human’s skin color assumes a darker hue the closer to the equator they live, while other features can vary immensely between locales. That said humans are generally recognizable from the other races, such as Elves and Dwarves, due to their averages of height, weight, ear shape, and other such details that may be much more pronounced or different with the other humanoid races.

Male humans tend to be anywhere from 5 feet to over 6 feet tall, with weights generally ranging from 130 to 220 lbs, with higher variance based on height, build, muscle mass or fat.

Female humans tend to be from 4’ 7” to 6 feet tall, with weights generally ranging from 95 to 185 lbs.

There exists exceptions to these numbers, but this is about on average what one could expect from a randomly selected human.

**Society**: The average human society is varied, due to being fairly widespread with various cultures and mindsets. Republics, Kingdoms, Theocracies, Magocracies, and even simple tribes exist across the world with varying rules and ideologies across each. Generally speaking humans tend to live in a much more varied state than their longer lived neighbors as with a new set of humans can come a new set of ideologies and values.

On the continent of Algrest human societies are fairly varied due to humans being the most common race of the continent.

Relations: Depending on the society, humans can be highly xenophobic or live in a society generally mixed with the other races. For the most part human societies exist in relative calm with other races, with the odd border dispute.

**Type**: Humanoid(Human)
