## Description

**Physical Description**: Halflings are a much smaller race, usually around 3 feet in height. Halflings seem odd to other races, preferring to walk barefoot, which exposes the tufts of hair on the top of their broad feet. Other than this halflings look a decent bit like smaller humans, with their other notable feature being their pointed ears, though generally similar size to a humanâ€™s rather than being long like an elf.

**Society**: Halfings tend to live in small villages rather than cities, keeping to a quieter farming life. Some halflings exist within human societies as well, living out their lives within the cities. Halflings live in an odd balance of being both the type to seek out peace and quiet and causing mischief; usually of the harmless variety, but their small stature and penchant for trouble can lead them quickly into a life of thievery in the large cities.

**Relations**: To this adaptability halflings tend to live in relative harmony with other races, generally capable of having a connection to both nature and civilization. As such it is not uncommon for even a halfling village to be under the rule of another kingdom, simply left alone or traded with for their quality crops, and not much more.

**Type**: Humanoid(Halfling)
