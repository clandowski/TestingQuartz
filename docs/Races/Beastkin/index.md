## Description

**Physical Description**: Beastkin, or known to some as the demihumans, are a race of human-like creatures who have some animalistic traits. Usually these traits manifest simply as animal-like ears and tails, though others may also have sharper fangs and claws. With these traits hidden though it's generally difficult to tell one apart from a standard human.

While visibly close to normal humans, even if their origins were once human, their physical abilities have definitely diverged much from normal humans over time, tending to be quite strong or agile, and sometimes in times of stress reverting to creatures of instinct.

The oddest part of beastkin is that their beastial features seem to follow no set pattern of heritage, as such a parent with fox-like ears and tails, may produce an offspring with features like a cat, with only hair color being similar between parent and child. This leads to beastkin looking somewhat more diverse even within small communes.

**Society**: Beastkin society depends largely on the opinion of the area on them. This is because the origin of beastkin is uncertain, ranging from stories of magic that twisted humans, ancient curses, or simply dark offspring of man and beast. There is no real information available as beastkin history is not well recorded, nor is their society well organized. As such beastkin exist as part of standard human societies in the ones they are welcome within, otherwise they exist in small villages and communes to escape the prejudices of their human neighbors.

**Relations**: Due to their lifespans being close to that of humans, they tend to never integrate well into the Dwarven or Elven societies either, though from time to time some beastkin have been found to live near or with wood elves.

Otherwise beastkin relations mostly depend on the local humanâ€™s view on the race, with some kingdoms treating them similar to other citizens, to others who actively hunt them down, viewing them as a blight upon their lands.

**Type**: Humanoid(Beastkin)
