Description: You sheathe yourself within a churning column of pure elemental water that fills your space and remains centered on you when you move. You gain a swim speed equal to half your land speed (minimum 5 feet), and can see, hear, and breathe normally within the seanmantle. The spell lasts as long as you concentrate on it, or you may spend 1 spell point to allow the spell to continue without concentration. At 5th BCB this swim speed improves to equal to your land speed.
