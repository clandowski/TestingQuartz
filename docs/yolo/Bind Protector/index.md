Prerequisites: See Text
Target: Adjacent Square
Duration: Concentration or 1 minute per BCB (see text)
Range: See Text
Action: 4 AP
Saving Throw: none
Spell Resistance: No
Description: |-
  You may spend a spell point to summon a creature, called a Protector, you have made a contract with causing it to appear in an adjacent square, ready to act on your following turn. You must concentrate to maintain the Protector�s presence, but may always spend an additional spell point to allow the summoned creature to remain for 1 minute per BCB without concentration.
  Protectors can take many forms decided by both its type and talents. While there are nearly no limits to how you may make your Protector look, you cannot choose a Protector with the exact same appearance as another creature. Regardless of what creature type a summoned Protector takes it always will have the Elemental with a subtype matching the affinity talent required to summon a creature of their base type; this in addition to any other types determined by their base type. For example a animal type would be both Beast, and a Elemental(Nature) type due to the nature affinity requirement.
  When you gain this spell, you automatically gain a single Protector of your choice. If a Protector is conjured multiple times during a day, they do not regain hit points or other resources spent. If a Protector is reduced to 0 hit points, they instantly disappear and cannot be summoned until the following day. A Protector only recovers hit points and resources (though may be healed through spells and other sources) when the caster rests to recover spell points. A Protector may be dismissed as a free action.
  While the home plane of a Protector is generally open for roleplay options, the creature for mechanical purposes simply ceases to exist when it is not summoned. Because of this it may not carry items or store items in their home plane or bring items to the caster�s plane. Talents that grant equipment are an exception, but also disappear when the creature is unsummoned. 
Special: |-
  To gain this spell you must qualify for a single Companion type to design your Protector with. Information on the progression and talents for Protectors can be found on the
  .
  If a creature already possesses this spell, but is granted this spell again they instead gain Extra Protector as a bonus talent. 
Note: |-
  (Spontaneous Vs Prepared) When a spontaneous caster gains this spell and talents that modify a Protector, the Protector is always summoned with the selected talents; this applies to talents applied to Protectors taken with the additional Protector talent. Effectively talents are applied to a Protector the moment the spontaneous caster gains the talent, without the ability to remove it later unless they would be able to un-learn and replace the talent.
  Prepared casters may decide their Protector and talents as part of preparing their spells each day, effectively creating a new contract to bind a creature meeting their specifications that day. For roleplay purposes that can be the same creature, simply modified each time; but this has no impact on the actual form or talents a creature would possess.
