Description: |-
  You attempt to grapple a single creature using the power of telekinesis. This spell allows you to make a grapple combat maneuver at range using your BCB in place of your BAB and your CAM in place of your strength modifier for determining your MSB. If successful the creature becomes grappled as if you were adjacent to them; and you may maintain the grapple, but cannot use this spell to pin, move, or damage a foe as part of sustaining the grapple. This grapple only may continue as long as you concentrate on the spell, dropping concentration immediately ends the grapple; performing the sustain as part of the action to concentrate on the spell each round. For the purposes of escaping the grapple the creature treats your CMD as equal to your CMB when using this spell rather than your usual CMD. If you fail to maintain the grapple or the creature successfully escapes the grapple the telekinetic grasp immediately ends.
  You may spend a spell point as part of casting this spell to allow your grapple with this spell to damage or move creatures when maintaining the grapple. When choosing to damage foes; allowing you to deal 1d6 + CAM damage on successfully initiating a grapple as well as on maintaining a grapple. When choosing to move a foe, you may move the creature 10 feet plus an additional 5 per 5 BCB you possess; this cannot move a creature vertically, nor go beyond the maximum range of the spell. In addition when you first grapple the creature with this spell you may deal damage to them as if you had chose to damage the creature as part of a maintain.
