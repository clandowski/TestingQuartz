Description: |-
  You may spend a spell point to cause rubbery black tentacles to pour out from the origin point of this spell. Every creature within the area of the spell is the target of a combat maneuver check made to grapple each round at the beginning of your turn, including the round that this spell is cast. Creatures that enter the area of effect are also automatically attacked. The tentacles do not provoke attacks of opportunity. When determining the tentaclesï¿½ MSB, the tentacles use your BCB as their BAB and your CAM as their Strength modifier. Roll only once for the entire spell effect each round and apply the result to all creatures in the area of effect. Just as with a normal grappler, this effect gains a +5 circumstance bonus on grapple checks made against targets it is already grappling, but cannot move foes or pin foes. A creature cannot take control of the grapple of the void tentacles' grapple
  Each round the tentacles succeed at a grapple check against a creature, that creature takes 1d6 (+1d6 per 4 BCB you possess) points of bludgeoning damage and gains the grappled condition. Grappled opponents cannot move without first breaking the grapple.
  The tentacles created by this spell cannot be damaged, but they can be dispelled as normal. The entire area of effect is considered difficult terrain while the tentacles last.
