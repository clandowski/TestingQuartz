title: Animate Dead
Keywords: Decay; Necromancy
Prerequisites: Decay(Nature-Anima) Affinity
Target: one humanoid corpse
Duration: instantaneous.
Range: Touch
Action: 4 AP
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
Description: |-
  You may spend a spell point to reanimate the body of a recently deceased creature, if the body is too decayed or too maimed to funcion (GM discretion) the spell may outright fail, or produce a defective undead (usually requiring at least 80% of a skeleton or body to still be present). Once animated the newly created undead lasts indefinitely until destroyed and is loyal to you.
  The statistics of this creature is determined by the type of creature it was in life, using the
  to determine specifics. The newly created undead has the same number of hit dice as when it was alive, selects a base form matching its form (usually biped for humanoids), and automatically gains the undead companion type. The companion gains the undead creature type as well gaining all the usual effects of this creature type. Otherwise the creature retains none of its abilities or special movement modes from when it was alive. The animated dead may benefit from any equipment it possessed or any you provide.
  You can control only 4 HD worth of undead creatures per BCB. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control, and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled. You choose which creatures are released. In addition you may decide at any point to relinquish control of any undead you currently control.
  Unlike normal companions, animated undead by default are mindless, possessing a 0 intelligence
  and having no feats or skill ranks
  , except for any proficiencies the base creature possessed. You may only issue simple commands to your controlled undead such as �go�, �stay�, �follow me�, �attack�, or �guard�; more complex commands are generally not understood by the undead.
  Unless otherwise specified you may not add companion talents to an animated dead like a normal companion, nor does it grow in strength as you gain additional BCB. When an animated dead is reduced to 0 hit points it is destroyed, and unable to be animated again.

The corpse used by this ability does not provoke attacks of opportunity for this movement. The combat maneuver attempted by the corpse uses your SPB in place of its BAB, and your CAM in place of Strength; adding any enhancement bonus from your implement to this combat maneuver. If choosing to grapple the corpse does not maintain the grapple, instead the creature gains the grappled condition until they break free from the corpse. Destroying the corpse may also end the grapple (the corpse has 12 hit points and DR 5/slashing).</td></tr></tbody></table></span></p><h2><span><p dir="auto">Greater Control</p></span></h2><p><span dir="ltr" style="overflow-x: auto;"><table><tbody><tr><th dir="ltr">Spell</th><td dir="ltr">Animate Dead</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Prerequisite</th><td dir="ltr">Animate Dead, BCB 12th</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Benefit</th><td dir="ltr">You may now control one additional hit dice of undead per BCB with the animate dead spell.</td></tr></tbody></table></span></p><h2><span><p dir="auto">Restorative Animation</p></span></h2><p><span dir="ltr" style="overflow-x: auto;"><table><tbody><tr><th dir="ltr">Spell</th><td dir="ltr">Animate Dead</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Prerequisite</th><td dir="ltr">Animate Dead, BCB 14th</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Benefit</th><td dir="ltr">You may spend an additional spell point when casting animate dead to cause the corpse you are animating to regenerate and restore itself, allowing a corpse to be animated as an undead despite any injuries, missing limbs, or excessive decay it may have possessed.

While within 30 feet of the head you may spend a 3 AP action to share senses with it, seeing and hearing from its location, and gaining the benefit of its vision types.
Once the head is created, you may set a triggering condition. If you are within 30 feet of the head, you immediately know if it is triggered, waking you from normal sleep. (for example it may alert you if a humanoid comes into view). The head otherwise cannot speak, think, or take any other action beyond turning itself. </td></tr></tbody></table></span></p><h2><span><p dir="auto">Undead Menagerie</p></span></h2><p><span dir="ltr" style="overflow-x: auto;"><table><tbody><tr><th dir="ltr">Spell</th><td dir="ltr">Animate Dead</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Prerequisite</th><td dir="ltr">Animate Dead, BCB 4th</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Benefit</th><td dir="ltr">You may animate any corpse, not just the corpses of humanoids.</td></tr></tbody></table></span></p><span><span><hr></span></span><h1><span><p dir="auto">Greater Dead Talents</p></span></h1><span><span><hr></span></span><h2><span><p dir="auto">Greater Undead</p></span></h2><p><span dir="ltr" style="overflow-x: auto;"><table><tbody><tr><th dir="ltr">Spell</th><td dir="ltr">Animate Dead</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Prerequisite</th><td dir="ltr">Animate Dead, BCB +2</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Benefit</th><td dir="ltr">Your animated dead�s Charisma is increased by 4, +1 per 2 Hit Dice.</td></tr></tbody></table></span></p><h2><span><p dir="auto">Intelligent Undead</p></span></h2><p><span dir="ltr" style="overflow-x: auto;"><table><tbody><tr><th dir="ltr">Spell</th><td dir="ltr">Animate Dead</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Prerequisite</th><td dir="ltr">Animate Dead, BCB 8th</td></tr><tr><th dir="ltr">Benefit</th><td dir="ltr">You may spend an additional spell point to cause your animated dead to gain rudimentary intelligence; gaining an intelligence score of 3.
