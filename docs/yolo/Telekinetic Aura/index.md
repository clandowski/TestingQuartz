Description: You form an aura of telekinetic energy pushing your body beyond its normal limits. This spell lasts for 1 round per BCB, but you may spend 1 spell point to allow the spell to last 1 minute per BCB. The effects of this spell are determined by the aura type talent applied to it, and may only have one telekinetic aura type talent applied to it.
Special: When you gain this spell, if you donï¿½t already have one, select a single telekinetic aura type talent that you qualify for (if you do not qualify for any aura type talents you cannot select this spell). For the purposes of prepared casters this spell does not take a slot to prepare, but also cannot be used without an aura type talent prepared, aura type talents take up slots as normal.
