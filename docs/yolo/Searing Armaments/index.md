Spell Resistance: Yes
Description: |-
  You concentrate on a creature in close range in an attempt to heat their held equipment. Make a Resilience(Psy) save attack against a creature. A successful save attack causes a metal weapon or other equipment they are holding to begin to rapidly heat as you continue to concentrate on the spell. The object becomes noticeably hotter in the first round but does not damage the creature. After sustaining the spell for 2 rounds the weapon begins to harm creatures attempting to hold it causing 1d4 points of fire damage for each round they continue to hold it.
  The damage improves by one step for each additional round the spell is concentrated on to a maximum of one step plus one step per 3 BCB. While most weapons are resistant to elemental damage, if this damage becomes enough to bypass the hardness of the weapon it may begin to damage the weapon each round due to the extreme heat. If you stop concentrating on the spell the weapon rapidly cools and returns to a safe temperature.
  The weapon while superheated in this way deals additional fire damage on attacks equal to ï¿½ the damage it causes the wielder.
  The caster may choose to instead allow the spell to continue without concentration by spending a spell point but without the concentration the spell becomes more fragile and the targeted creature is allowed a new save each round.
