Prerequisites: Fire(Essence) Affinity
Target: Self
Duration: Concentration or 1 minute per BCB (see description)
Range: Personal
Action: 4 AP
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
Description: |-
  You create an illusionary copy of yourself which shares your space and mimics your movements for as long as you concentrate, or you may spend a spell point to allow it to continue without concentration for up to 1 minute per BCB. If you move, any copies you have move with you.
  Attacks and spells requiring an attack roll targeting you have a chance to target the illusionary copy instead. The copy uses your touch AC, and is destroyed on a successful attack roll against it. At 6 BCB, and every 6 BCB thereafter, an additional copy is created; while concentrating to maintain this spell, you regain 1 copy at the start of your turn if you are below your maximum number of copies (1 + 1 per 6 BCB). Roll for each attack to determine whether the attack is targeting a copy (for example, a 1d4 with 3 copies present). The spell ends when no copies remain, even if you are concentrating to maintain it. Area spells and spells which do not require an attack roll are not affected by your copies, nor do they destroy them.
  The attacker must be able to see the illusion to be fooled. If you are invisible or the attacker is blind, the attacker need not roll to determine if it is attacking the copy.
