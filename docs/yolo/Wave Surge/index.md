Description: |-
  You may spend a spell point to create a wave of water that starts at your location and moves 30 feet per round in a direction of your choosing to a maximum of close range. Creatures struck by the wave are subject to a trip maneuver using your BCB in place of your BAB and your CAM in place of your Strength for determining your MSB for this manuever. On success the creatures struck are knocked prone, on one degree of success or higher they are also carried by the wave during the waveï¿½s movement for this round. You receive a +5 bonus to this check if the creature is already caught within the wave. Creatures may attempt a MSB or Athletics check to swim attempt against the MSB on their turn to escape the wave on their turn, though the creature is limited by their usual swim speed for how far they can swim out of the wave. Creatures within the wave may begin the suffocate if they cannot breathe in water and receive only half their usual time to hold their breath due to the battering motions of the wave.
  The wave is 10 feet high, 5 feet long, and 5 feet wide. Objects larger than the wave stop all movement of the wave and immediately end the spell, while creatures of larger size can still be tripped by the wave but not carried by it if they are larger than the wave.
  At 8th BCB you may spend an additional spell point when casting this spell to improve the size of the wave by an additional 5 feet in length, width, and height.
