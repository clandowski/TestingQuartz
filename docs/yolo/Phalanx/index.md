Description: You may spend a spell point to enhance the effect of a worn or held object that provides a shield bonus to your AC, allowing it to provide all the same benefits that it provides to the bearer to allies within 5 feet plus an additional 5 feet per 5 BCB. Allies receive the same bonus to AC, and may benefit from any enhancements, spells, effects, class features, and feats that the bearer could benefit from (however if these would require an action or reaction to activate it must be spent by the bearer rather than the ally).
