Description: |-
  You may spend a spell point to conjure a wall composed of an element you possess an affinity for at a space within range. This wall may be as large as one 5-foot square per BCB, and each square must be placed adjacent to another section of wall in a continuous line. Additional effects, saving throws, and details are determined by the wall type talent applied to this spell when casting. Once the spell ends the wall dissipates leaving no material behind.
  Duration of wall talents is generally determined by the individual wall type talent. 
Special: When you gain this spell, you gain all wall type talent that you qualify for (if you do not qualify for any wall type talents you cannot select this spell). For the purposes of prepared casters this spell does not take a slot to prepare, but also cannot be used without a wall type talent prepared, wall type talents take up slots as normal.
