  You may spend a spell point to concentrate on a single creature. Each turn you may give the targeted creature a single command, which it obeys to the best of its ability from the following list
  Come: On its turn the creature moves towards you as quickly as possible for 1 round, taking no other action but moving during its turn. This movement may provoke attacks of opportunity as normal.
  Go: On its turn the creature moves away from you as quickly as possible for 1 round, taking no other action but moving during its turn. This movement may provoke attacks of opportunity as normal.
  Drop: On its turn the creature drops whatever it is holding. It may not pick up any dropped item on the same turn it dropped it.
  Fall: The subject falls prone on its turn. It may not stand up on the same turn, but may act normally while prone, taking penalties as normal.
  Halt: The subject stands in place for 1 round. It may not take any actions but is not treated as helpless.
  Kill: You give the target an urge to kill its nearest ally, which it obeys to the best of its ability. The target attacks its nearest ally on its turn with a melee attack. The target will move or charge to itï¿½s nearest ally to make this attack, or will use its turn to get as close as possible if unable to..
  For the duration of the spell the creature receives a new Resilience(Psy) save to attempt to end the spell on each of its turns, forcing a new save attack from the caster each time. Each round the caster must spend a 2 AP action to give a new command even if it's the same command as the previous round. You may spend an additional spell point to allow the spell to continue without concentration.
