Description: |-
  You magically enhance your voice to become a weapon causing the reverberations to push and knock creatures off balance. Creatures in a 15 foot cone are subject to a bull rush reposition maneuver using your BCB in place of your BAB and your CAM in place of your strength for determining your MSB. A successful maneuver pushes creatures back 5 feet and subjects them to a Physical(Str) save attack, with a success causing the creature to become staggered for 1 round.
  You may instead spend 1 spell point as part of casting this spell to cause creatures to instead be pushed an amount of distance appropriate to your combat maneuver result (as per the shove reposition combat maneuver). In addition creatures are subject to the save attack regardless if the maneuver is successful or not with a success by two degrees or more instead causing them to become dazed for 1 round.
