Target: One Illusionary Object
Duration: Concentration or 1 minute per BCB (see description)

Saving Throw: Mental (see text)
Spell Resistance: No
Description: |-
  You project a simple illusion of light and sound which you may maintain or make alterations to for as long as you continue to concentrate, or you may spend a spell point to allow it to continue without concentration for up to 1 minute per BCB.
  This illusion can create a medium sized object or creature (or 2 small sized objects or creatures, or 4 tiny sized objects or creatures, and so on) somewhere within range, with limited ability to move. The illusion remains in the space it was created but may move around within it to seem more realistic (such as a chicken pecking at the ground). You may command the illusion to move up to 30 feet as a 2 AP action (if you created multiple creatures or objects that were not part of a grouping, such as a swarm, you must command each separately). The maximum size of the illusion increases to large (or 2 medium sized, and so on) at 4 BCB, and by an additional size category every 4 BCB thereafter.
  Illusionary creatures can be given simple behaviors to repeat, or can repeat up to a single sentence, and both of these patterns can be set to activate on a trigger (such as someone entering a room). Illusionary objects can appear lifelike but are restricted to simple designs such as a tree, rock, or building, and donï¿½t cast shadows.
  You may see through your own illusions, but other creatures cannot unless they first recognize them as fake. A creature that successfully saves against an illusion sees it as a hazy representation of what it was, and is able to see through it even if it would normally block sight, but the partially visible illusion still grants concealment to creatures and objects covered by it.
  Any creature that interacts with the illusion is entitled to a Mental saving throw to recognize it as a fake. A creature interacts with an illusion (for the purpose of determining whether it is entitled to a save) if it touches it (such as walking onto an illusionary floor), successfully attacks it (such as ambushing an illusionary guardsman), is successfully attacked by it (such as being rolled over by an illusionary boulder), or attempts to engage with it through a skill check other than Perception (such as attempting to fish in an illusionary lake or trying to gather information from an illusionary guard captain).
  A creature gains a +5 bonus on a save to disbelieve any illusion that it is already suspicious of, a +10 bonus against illusions that are implausible to believe, and a +15 bonus if it is already aware of the illusion (such as by another creature pointing it out).
  When you cast this spell you may decide whether your allies recognize the illusion as a fake.
