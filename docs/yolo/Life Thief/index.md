Description: |-
  The creature successfully touched by this spell has the effectiveness of healing reduced on them. Until the effect ends, whenever the target is subject to a healing spell or supernatural effect that heals hit points, the target only receives half the healing(rounded down). Once youï¿½ve prevented 5 hit points of healing per BCB with this spell, the spell is discharged.
  You may spend 1 spell point as part of casting to cause the healing prevented by life thief to be redirected to you. You must remain within 25 feet + 5 feet per two BCB of the target to gain this benefit. 
Special: when applying a shape talent to this spell, you target creatures within the area with a Resilience(Psy) save attack. A failed Resilience(Psy) save attack negates the effects of the spell.
