title: Alter Self
Keywords: Polymorph
Prerequisites: See Text
Target: One Creature
Duration: Concentration or 1 minute per BCB(see description)
Range: Personal
Action: 4 AP
Saving Throw: Resilience
Spell Resistance: Yes
Description: |-
  You can alter yourself for as long as you concentrate or you can spend a spell point to allow the spell to continue without concentration for 1 minute per BCB; and may dismiss the spell as a 3 AP action.
  When using alter self the caster applies a series of traits to themself. Traits are obtained from Alter and Form talents, but traits themselves do not change a creature�s base physical form, but instead apply special characteristics (such as natural attacks, size, movement modes, size adjustments, etc..). The caster may grant a maximum number of traits equal to 2 + 1 per 5 BCB and cannot grant the same trait more than once unless specified otherwise.
  The list of traits you may apply are pulled from any known form or alter talents known. If a trait would grant a limb your form talent already grants you may gain the additional limb or choose not to (but still gain any benefits related to gaining that limb such as the aquatic form tail riptide). 
Special: When you gain this spell, if you don�t already have one, select a single form or alter universal talent that you qualify for (if you do not qualify for any form talents you cannot select this spell). For the purposes of prepared casters this spell does not take a slot to prepare, but also cannot be used without a form talent prepared, additional form or alter talents take up slots as normal.
