Description: |-
  You may begin to concentrate on an ongoing flame within close range. You may affect a flame of medium size category or lower. You may spend a spell point to instead allow the spell to continue without concentration for 1 round per BCB; and does not allow the caster to change what flame they are currently altering.
  As part of casting the spell you may determine what action you wish to take on the flame. If the caster is concentrating on the spell they can choose one of the following actions to perform as part of concentrating. If allowing the spell to continue without concentration you must instead spend 3 AP each round on the following actions.
    \* Move: You may force the flame to begin to move through the air; otherwise the flame remains within the last moved location. Once the spell ends, if the fire does not have a valid surface or fuel to continue burning, the flame is immediately extinguished. Creatures that come in contact with the flame take damage at the start of their turn appropriate for the size of the fire (see mundane fire rules). You may move a flame up to 10 feet + 5 feet per 2 BCB.
  \* Grow/Shrink: You can cause the flame to grow or shrink by one size category per 4 BCB. The maximum size you can grow the flame is medium. Once the spell ends the fire will return to its normal size, though this may cause the flame to devour the fuel it was burning on faster during the time it was grown. If a flame would be shrunk below the size of Fine it is instead immediately extinguished. Growing or shrinking a flame requires a 3 AP action.
  This spell can only affect mundane (non-magical) fires, not fire sustained by magical effects, or fires being affected by other casts of Alter Flame.
