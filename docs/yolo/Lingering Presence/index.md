Target: You
Duration: Concentration, plus 1 round per BCB
Range: Personal
Action: 4 AP
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
Description: |-
  You may spend a spell point to leave behind a briefly lingering echo of your presence. When you take an action to move (including performing a shift) you leave an echo in the space where your movement began, which lasts until the start of your next turn. This echo does not block movement for allies or enemies, but does count as your space for the purposes of providing flanking, threatened area (including making attacks of opportunity), and the origin point of effects centered on you (such as the championï¿½s Aura class feature); this does not create two separate effects, rather, it creates an additional area covered by the same effect.
  This effect repeats every turn for as long as you concentrate, and for 1 round per BCB after you stop concentrating.
