Description: You may spend a spell point to touch a willing creature and create a suit of armor, or a shield, with which you are proficient; this is made of metal, stone, or ice, but uses the normal statistics for an armor or shield of that type. If the target creature is already wearing armor, the created armor reinforces what is already there, filling in gaps and adding extra layers; use the higher (for armor bonus, strength rating, and weight category) value between the worn and created armor, and apply any special features (other than nimble) from both armors. The created armor takes damage before any other armor for the purposes of armor redirection and armor sacrifice, and has a number of hit points equal to 5 per BCB plus your CAM. The spell ends when the conjured armor reaches 0 hit points, but it is not considered broken at half hit points. Either the caster or the creature wearing the created armor may dismiss the spell as a 2 AP action.
