Description: |-
  You must target an area with at least some grass, vines, or other vegetation. You cause plants to grow rapidly, wrapping themselves around everything within the targeted area. You make a Physical save attack against creatures in the area, on a success the creature gains the entangled condition and becomes unable to move. Creatures that succeed at their save can move as normal, but those that remain in the area must save again at the end of each turn the area persists. Creatures that move into the area must save immediately.
  Creatures that fail against your save attack end their movement and gain the entangled condition. Entangled creatures can break free as a 2 AP action, if they succeed at a sunder MSB check or Escape Artist check (against the original save attack for the spell). This area is also considered difficult terrain for the duration of the effect.
  This spell may be maintained through concentration, or the caster may spend a spell point to allow the spell to continue without concentration.
