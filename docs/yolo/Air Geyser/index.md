Description: You may spend a spell point to create a powerful blast capable of flinging an opponent upward. Upon casting this spell you make a reposition combat maneuver against the target using your BCB in place of your BAB and your CAM in place of your strength modifier to determine your MSB. If successful the target creature takes 2d6 wind damage and is hurled directly upwards 10 feet plus the distance normally allowed by a reposition maneuver. If the creature strikes a solid object such as a ceiling they are dealt a number of points of damage as if they had fallen. Once the effect ends the creature falls (unless they possess flight), taking fall damage as normal for the distance fallen. If the maneuver fails the creature instead takes half damage and is not moved. The damage of this spell improves by an additional 1d6 at 5th BCB and every 5 BCB thereafter.
