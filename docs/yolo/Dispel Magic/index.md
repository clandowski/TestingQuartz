Description: |-
  You may spend one spell point to attempt to end an ongoing spell that has been cast on a creature or object. Make a dispel check (1d20+SPB); you may target a specific effect if you have identified it, otherwise the effect with the highest BCB on the target is automatically targeted. Compare your dispel result against the spell (1d20 + the SPB of the spell). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare that same result to the spell with the next highest BCB, repeating until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell. Use the same d20 roll for each spell effect you compare against rather than rerolling each time.
  If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a creature summoned by summon companion) is in the area, apply the dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel one spell targeting the creature or object. You may also target a single spell affecting an area such as grasping vines or black tentacles to attempt to end the effect.
