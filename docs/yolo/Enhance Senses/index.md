title: Enhance Senses
Keywords: Transmutation
Prerequisites: Nature(Essence) Affinity
Target: You
Duration: Concentration, or 1 minute per BCB (see Description).
Range: Personal
Action: 4 AP
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No
Description: |-
  You may grant yourself enhanced senses, improving your ability to search for and notice minute details, depending on the Sense Type talent applied to it. You may attempt a Perception check using that sense type as part of casting this spell (normally making a non-reactionary Perception check is a 2 AP action); you may roll twice and take the better result on this check. You may concentrate to maintain this effect, making another Perception check each round with a cumulative +1 circumstance bonus on that check (up to a maximum of your BCB).
  You may spend an additional spell point to allow this effect to persist for 1 minute per BCB, but doing so only grants its benefits when taking a 2 AP action to attempt a non-reactionary Perception check (including granting the cumulative bonus on Perception checks made during consecutive rounds).
  You may spend a spell point when casting this spell to instead create the effect as a lens, mirror, music box, or other hand-held object which allows you to share the benefits of this spell with adjacent creatures (allowing each creature adjacent to you to make a Perception check as a free action when the spell is cast, or at the start of your turn). 
Special: When you gain this spell, if you donï¿½t already have one, select a single Sense Type talent that you qualify for (if you do not qualify for any Sense Type talents you cannot select this spell). For the purposes of prepared casters, this spell does not take a slot to prepare but also cannot be used without a Sense Type talent prepared; Sense Type talents take up slots as normal.
