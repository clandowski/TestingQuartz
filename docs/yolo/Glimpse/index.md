Description: You may spend a spell point to glimpse into the future, granting you a bonus on an attack, skill check, or other action. Additional effects, saving throws, and details are determined by the glimpse type talent applied to this spell when casting. Unless otherwise specified, once the effect has been triggered the spell ends and does not grant the bonus for an additional action.
Special: When you gain this spell, if you donï¿½t already have one, select a single glimpse type talent that you qualify for (if you do not qualify for any wall type talents you cannot select this spell). For the purposes of prepared casters this spell does not take a slot to prepare, but also cannot be used without a glimpse type talent prepared, glimpse type talents take up slots as normal.
