Description: |-
  You may spend a spell point to create a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands, similar to spiderwebs, trapping those caught in them. Any creature in the effect's area when the spell is cast, or enters the area later, is subject to a Physical save attack. If it succeeds the creature becomes entangled, on one degree of success or more the creature is instead staggered. A creature can break free by making a MSB or Escape Artist check as a 3 AP action against the save attack of this spell. Regardless of success or failure the area is treated as difficult terrain. When placing a web it must be anchored to two or more solid and opposed points, or on a solid surface such as a wall or floor.
  If you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of web between you, it provides total cover. The strands of a web spell are flammable. A weapon that deals fire damage can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire can set the webs alight and burn away one 5-foot square in 1 round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames. 
Special: If you possess the Wall spell you may spend an additional spell point to instead create a wall in a continuous line containing one 5-foot square per BCB. Each end of the continuous line must still be anchored to a solid point.
