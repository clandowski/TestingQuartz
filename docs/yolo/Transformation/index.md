title: Transformation
Keywords: Polymorph
Prerequisites: See Text
Target: One Creature
Duration: Concentration or 1 minute per BCB(see description) (Dismissible)
Range: Touch
Action: 4 AP
Saving Throw: Resilience
Spell Resistance: Yes
Description: |-
  You can change the form of yourself or a touched willing creature for as long as you concentrate or you can spend a spell point to allow the spell to continue without concentration for 1 minute per BCB; and may dismiss the spell as a 3 AP action.
  When using transformation the caster must choose a
  form talent
  , as well as apply a series of traits for them. Form talents change a creature�s physical form (dragon, animal, humanoid), while traits are special characteristics (such as natural attacks, size, movement modes, etc..). The caster may grant a maximum number of traits equal to 2 + 1 per 5 BCB and cannot grant the same trait more than once unless specified otherwise.
  A form talent causes that creature�s physical form to change into that of another creature, gaining any listed limbs and losing others that it possessed. �The target loses any extraordinary or supernatural abilities, natural attacks, and movement types dependent on their original form (darkvision, scent, wings, claws, etc., usually granted by a character�s race) and gains the listed benefits in their place. Alternate sources of physical traits (such as a class feature that grants a natural weapon) still function.
  The list of traits you may apply are pulled from any known form or alter talents known. If a trait would grant a limb your form talent already grants you may gain the additional limb or choose not to (but still gain any benefits related to gaining that limb such as the aquatic form tail riptide). 
Special: When you gain this spell, if you don�t already have one, select a single form universal talent that you qualify for (if you do not qualify for any form talents you cannot select this spell). For the purposes of prepared casters this spell does not take a slot to prepare, but also cannot be used without a form talent prepared, form and alter talents take up slots as normal.
