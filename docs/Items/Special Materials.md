Most equipment is made out of wood, leather, or some type of metal. Though some different materials may be utilized in the construction of a piece of equipment, changing it in some way or granting it new properties. A piece of equipment may only be made of one special material.

## Adamantine
### Armor

Armor made of adamantine gains the double-plated and strong special armor features. If the armor already has either of these special features the benefit increases by an additional 2.

Adamantine armor has the following differences depending on the category of armor. Adamantine armor's cost and hardness increases already factored into the chart below.


|Armor Type|Hardness|Additional Cost.|
|---|---|---|
|Light|18|+4,000|
|Heavy|20|+6,000|

### Weapons

Weapons made of adamantine gain the Strong and Sunder weapon special features.

If the weapon already possesses the strong feature it improves the benefit from it by an additional 2. If the weapon already possesses the Sunder feature the weapon allows the ignoring of 2 points of hardness of any object it is damaging that is not also made of adamantine.

Adamantine weapons have the following differences depending on the category of weapon.


|Weapon Type|Hardness|Additional Hit Points|Additional Cost.|
|---|---|---|---|
|Light|18|+4|+1,000|
|One-Handed|19|+7|+2,000|
|Two-Handed|20|+10|+3,000|

## Mithral

Mithral may be only applied to armor or weapons with the metal keyword.

Mithral is a special type of metal with the ability to be as effective as steel but weigh considerably less. It is a favorite of those who wish to lighten their load without compromising the integrity of their equipment.

### Armor

Armor made of mithral has its weight reduced by half and gains the nimble special armor feature. Armor that already has the nimble property may treat the base attack bonus of its wearer as 10 higher for the purposes of how much of its armor bonus may be applied to touch AC.

|Armor Type|Hardness|Additional Cost.|
|---|---|---|
|Light|14|+3000|
|Heavy|15|+5000|

### Weapons

One-handed weapons made of mithral weigh half as much and gain the lightweight special weapon feature. One-handed weapons already with the lightweight feature as well as light weapons reduce the penalty for two-weapon fighting by an additional 1 (minimum 0)

Oversized weapons, or two-handed weapons wielded in one hand (such as from the giantâ€™s grip feat) reduce the penalty to attack rolls by 1 (minimum 0).

|Weapon Type|Hardness|Additional Cost.|
|---|---|---|
|Light|14|+1000|
|One-Handed|14|+2000|
|Two-handed|15|+3000|
