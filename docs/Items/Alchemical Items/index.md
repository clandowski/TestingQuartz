title: Alchemical Items
---
lchemy is the application of materials from both magical and mundane sources to create objects of various effects. Rather than a form of casting, alchemy instead utilizes the pharmaceutical applications of objects, as well as the magical properties of ingredients.
# Basic Alchemy

For basic alchemy, each alchemical item has a combination of rank and rarity to determine both its effectiveness and cost of production

- **Rarity**: The rarity of the item generally correlates to the base power or difficulty to create the item. The rarity determines the base Craft DC, and base cost of the item.
- **Rank**: The rank of the item usually dictates the effectiveness of the item, with items starting at the minimum rank (usually rank 1). The cost of the item is directly multiplied by the rank of the item. The effect the rank has on the individual item effectiveness is determined by the item that is being used.

There are three types of mundane alchemical items, all determining how they must be applied to affect a creature.

- **Active**: Active alchemical items require a specific process to be utilized, detailed within their item description.
    - Unless otherwise specified most alchemical splash weapons are active alchemical items and are activated as part of throwing them.
- **Contact**: A contact alchemical item is applied when they come in contact with an object or creature. If the target of the contact item is unwilling it must be applied with a melee touch attack, or a ranged touch attack with a 10 foot range increment (maximum 5 range increments). All contact items may be applied to oneself or a willing creature as a 3 AP action.
- **Ingested**: The effects of these items occur once a creature consumes the item.

When an alchemical item calls for a save DC; alchemical save attacks are usually determined by the crafter. Usually this is calculated at 10 + ½ ranks in craft alchemy + Intelligence Modifier + Rarity Save attack bonus.

If the item was not crafted by a player and the save DC was not already defined for the item when it was obtained, then the minimum save DC should be the following (these bonuses include the save DC bonus for the rarity):

- Common: DC 15
- Uncommon: DC 20
- Rare: DC 25
- Exceptional: DC 30
- Legendary: DC 35

## Crafting Alchemical Items

Crafting most alchemical items requires a Profession(Alchemist) check, the base cost, progress per day, and crafting DC of the item is determined by the base rarity of the item. Each item also has a complexity modifier indicating how much the DC is raised or lowered due to the complexity of making the item; for example a Simplistic item would reduce the base crafting DC by 5. If the item has a minimum rank then this is also factored into the base cost and DC; adding +5 to the DC per rank above 1, and increasing the gold cost incrementally based upon the rank of the item.

When the crafter makes their final profession check to finish the item, for each degree of success beyond the base crafting DC the item may be crafted at a rank higher (to the maximum rank of the listen item). The crafter may choose to craft the item at a lower rank if desired. If crafted at a higher rank, more time/progress is not required, but the crafter must supply the gold cost of the final item (paying the difference between the gold they already supplied to craft the item at base cost and the listed cost increase per additional rank). See the crafting rules under the Profession skill page for more information on crafting.

When crafting an item, the crafter may increase the save DC bonus of the item by one step by increasing the craft DC by 10, effectively treating the item as if it was one rarity rank higher. This cannot raise the save DC bonus beyond +5.
