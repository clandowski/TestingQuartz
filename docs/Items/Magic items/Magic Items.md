Magic items are a series of tools at a player’s disposal to increase their versatility. If a magic item would call for a save attack the caster may substitute it with 1d20 + ½ their ranks in UMD + his Psyche modifier. Many magic items will have a save DC rather than a normal attack roll, effectively treating the save attack as if it had rolled a 10.

Magic items have a BCB listed, but this is for the purpose of crafting and other effects and is not a requirement to utilize or wear the magic item.

# Magic Item Slots

Magic items come in 2 forms, slotted and slotless. Slotted magic items may be activated without holding them, but occupy a specific part of a character’s body. Two magic items cannot occupy the same slot and both become inoperable until one is removed.

Slots Include the following:

- Head - [[./List of Magic Items/List of Head Slot Magic Items|List of Head Slot Magic Items]]
- Neck - [[./List of Magic Items/List of Neck Slot Magic Items|List of Neck Slot Magic Items]]
- Body - [[./List of Magic Items/List of Body Slot Magic Items|List of Body Slot Magic Items]]
- Hand(2) - [[./List of Magic Items/List of Hand Slot Magic Items|List of Hand Slot Magic Items]]
- Feet - [[./List of Magic Items/List of Foot Slot Magic Items|List of Foot Slot Magic Items]]

If a creature would lack an appropriate appendage a reasonable substitution may be suggested, but generally that creature is disallowed from wearing that magic item. For example a creature without legs and feet would be unable to wear feet slot items; though a creature without arms, but has tentacles, may be able to wear a ring or wrist slot item on them.

A creature with a hand slot has 2 hand slots as some items may only be equipped to a single hand, though some items may come in pairs and as such occupy both hand slots. Items that do not specify that they come in pairs can be equipped to a single hand allowing a different hand slot item on each hand.

### Creatures With Nonstandard Bodies
Creatures like Centaurs or Serpentfolk don't have a standard humanoid body, but are still able to utilize magic items as normal. Unless otherwise specified a creature simply has a magic item made for their 

## Magic Item Attunement

Before a magic item within a slot may be worn, it must first be attuned to. Attunement begins at the start of each day, usually after a creature has performed their rest, though a creature can perform attunement at any point during the day. Attuning to an item takes a 3 AP action once it is worn in a slot.

Magic items worn in slots cannot be utilized until attuned to, and once attuned the wearer of that item cannot utilize a different magic item in that slot until they take an 8 hour rest and gain the opportunity to attune to a different magic item.

Items that were previously attuned to before the rest may be chosen to be automatically attuned to again at the start of the day without spending an action, though if the character does not choose to renew the attunement then the item cannot be used until it has been attuned to.

A creature may re-attune to a new magic item, despite being already attuned to another a number of times per day equal to their Psyche modifier (minimum 1). Doing removed attunement from the previous item and attunes them to the new item, making them unable to utilize the previously attuned item until they are able to attune again to it.

## Magic Item Binding

Anytime a creature attunes to a magic item it becomes bound to them. A bound magic item cannot be utilized by other creatures until it has been un-bound from them. A creature may choose to un-bind from an item as part of un-attuning from an item if they choose to.

Items bound to a creature are only able to be sold at 10% their base value due to the costly process to re-utilize the magic item. Bound items may be broken down for their components (still at 10% their base value), or may be reforged to make them usable again. Reforging a magic item requires the difference between the normal sell value and the bound sell value in cost to properly remake the item (thus the difference between 50% and 10% of its value).

# Temporary Magic Items

Items marked as temporary are items usually with a limited function. These items do not take up a slot as normal, nor are they restricted to the attunement system. Instead a temporary magic item has its own special slot in which only one of the item may be equipped at a time; otherwise no temporary magic items will function until the excess is removed.. A temporary magic item may only be used while equipped, though may be unequipped at any time. Most temporary magic items have a single use or limited number of uses before they are spent; once a temporary magic item is spent a new temporary magic item may be equipped without conflict with the previous.

# Slotless Magic items

A slotless magic item usually requires the creature to be holding the item to activate it, similar to wielding a weapon or implement. These items usually will describe their function and their general use, and usually do not conflict with other magic item slots even when equipped or worn.

# Creating Magic Items

A character may attempt to craft their own magical items rather than paying for them, similar to crafting any other item. By default a character must have a BCB to craft an item, but some feats and abilities may allow a creature to substitute their skill ranks in place of BCB.

First to create a magic item you must have at least 75% of the cost of the item in materials to perform the craft. Next you must have a BCB greater than or equal to the listed BCB of the item being crafted.

Finally creating the item works similarly to crafting using a profession check, but using your BCB and your CAM instead of the skill. The DC to craft the item is DC 15 + the BCB requirement to craft the item. For each degree of success you exceed the DC you improve the progress you make for the day by double (one degree being double, two degrees being triple, and three degrees being quadruple and so-on). If you successfully exceed the cost of the item by 5 degrees of success you gain the usual progress increase, but also reduce the cost of crafting the item by 5% (to a minimum of 50% of the cost of the item). Items are crafted at 1,000 gp of progress each day.  

Progress in excess of what is needed for the item may be applied to the next magic item even if it's not exactly the same type of item, or different special abilities), though cannot be applied to other forms of crafting.

A failed check results in no progress, but a failure by one degree or greater causes a waste of raw materials equal to the base progress of the item that day, to a maximum of the initial cost (the 75% of cost in raw materials).

To complete an item you have gained enough progress for, the crafter must make a final check against the craft DC of the item. If successful the item is finished; some items gain additional benefits based on the degrees of success of this final check. If this check fails by less than one degree the final cost of the item is increased by 50%, but the item is still finished. A failure by one degree or more fails to craft the item.
