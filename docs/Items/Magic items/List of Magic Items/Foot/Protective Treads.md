effect: When walking through a terrain hazard mundane or magical, such as the Thorny vines talent of the grasping vines spell, you may utilize the armor redirection ability to reduce the damage of the terrain, despite it not being an effect that would target the wearer's AC. In addition, as a reaction the wearer may choose to ignore any difficult terrain caused by such hazardous terrain when redirecting the damage to his armor for the remainder of his turn; this may only be used a number of times per day equal to the wearer's Psyche modifier (minimum 1).
