effect: A magic carpet is an enchanted carpet that is capable of carrying creatures with flight. A magic carpet grants a creature standing or sitting upon it a 30 ft fly speed with perfect maneuverability, allowing the creature to guide and fly it using a 2 AP action. A creature cannot 5 ft-step using a flying carpet’s fly speed, though can physically take a 5-foot step on the carpet, if it has enough space upon it to do so. For every 5 Psyche modifier the controlling creature possesses, the carpet’s fly speed improves by 10 feet. Should a creature be knocked off a flying carpet (such as through a reposition or other such maneuver) the carpet ceases to maintain its flight and begins to plummet after 1 round unless another creature is there to take control.  Taking control of a flying carpet is a purely mental 4 AP action and can only be done if the carpet is not already controlled by another creature.  A carpet by default is a 5x5 square, though for +100% cost can be made one size category larger (10x10, 15x15, and so on). If the carpet has enough space multiple creatures may ride upon it but only one creature is treated as in control. A magic carpet has 350 lbs of capacity doubling as the size of the carpet increases.  Most carpets have simple ornate designs, though a creature may craft, or request a carpet be crafted with a specific design or imagery.
