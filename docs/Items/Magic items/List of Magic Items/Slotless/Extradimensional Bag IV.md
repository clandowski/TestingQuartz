effect: A bag of holding opens into an extradimensional space, allowing it to hold more than its outside dimensions would physically allow. A Tier 3 bag of holding can holy up to 1000 lbs of items within its storage. If a bag of holding is pierced from the outside or turned inside out its contents spill out unharmed, but the bag ceases to function until put right. A bag of holding within an area of anti-magic will contain its items until opened, at which point all items within spill out; this can be avoided by leaving the area of anti-magic.  A bag of holding cannot be placed within another bag of holding as the magics prevent it from being put in.  Creatures placed within the bag have only 10 minutes of air before they must hold their breath and risk suffocation; though opening the bag can let fresh air in. Unless otherwise specified a bag of holding cannot be opened from the inside once closed, nor can it be damaged from the inside.  Due to its spacious area and difficulty to organize, retrieving an item from a bag of holding requires a 4 AP action; items cease to provide benefits while within the bag of holding.
