effect: An item commonly associated with that of witches, a flying broom is enchanted to allow for flight. A creature riding upon a flying broom is treated as if affected by the overland flight ritual while riding upon it, requiring a 4 AP action to fly each round. A creature must have at least one hand gripping a flying broom, or must make a DC 15 ride check to avoid falling off. The rider may choose to add their Psyche modifier in place of their Dexterity for this ride check. A flying broom can only support one medium sized creature, but may support a creature of one size category larger at a +50% increase to the cost per size increase.
