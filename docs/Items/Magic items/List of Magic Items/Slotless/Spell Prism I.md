effect: A spell prism is a magic item allowing a spellcaster to store a portion of their power for later use. As a 4 AP action a spell prism may be charged with a single spell point from the spellcaster; once changed this way the spell prism remains changed until this charge is spent. A spellcaster may use a spell prism as a free action as part of casting a spell to supply a single spell point to the spell. Spells cast in this way have a maximum BCB of 5th, they may be cast at and thus even if your BCB would be higher the spell must be undercast to the level of the spell prism. If a spell would require additional spell points to cast the spellcaster must supply the additional spell points on their own. If undercasting a spell this way would bring the BCB of a spell too far below the minimum prerequisites of the spell it cannot be cast with this tier of Spell Prism and requires a higher tier one. In addition a spellcaster must have a BCB equal to or higher than the maximum BCB of the spell prism to supply it a spell point, as otherwise their magic is insufficient to power the spell prism.
