effect: This pair of enchanted mithral manacles can be utilized to neutralize the casting capabilities of a spellcaster they are tied to. While placed onto a creature it prevents the usage of spells, supernatural abilities, and natural spells of that creature as if they were affected by an anti-magic field. The power of Tier 4 manacles suppress the abilities of a creature whose hit dice are greater than 11 hit dice creatures; requiring more powerful manacles to prevent casting from more powerful creatures. These manacles otherwise function as mithral manacles for the purpose of escaping them.
