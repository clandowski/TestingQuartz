effect: The wearer of this cloak may spend a reaction when grappled to attempt a bull rush reposition maneuver against the foe using the wearer’s Psyche modifier in place of their strength and their hit dice in place of their Base Attack Bonus. This maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If successful the grapple immediately ends as the foe is pushed away from the wearer from the bull rush. This may be activated a number of times per day equal to the wearer’s Psyche modifier (minimum 1).
