effect: This magical cloak allows the wearer to blend in with their surroundings. As a 2 AP action the wearer of this cloak can cause the cloak to take on the appearance of its surroundings granting a circumstance bonus to stealth equal to the wearer’s Psyche modifier (minimum 2) while the wearer does not move any distance during their turn. This bonus is reduced by half if the wearer moves any distance during their turn.<br><br>The cloak retains this appearance until it is set to take on the appearance of new surroundings; and thus provides no benefit to stealth when within the incorrect environment.
