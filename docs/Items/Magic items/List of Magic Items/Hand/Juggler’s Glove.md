effect: This pair of gloves may be bought as a single item or as a pair. Normally these gloves provide no bonus, but have a slot for an enhancement gem and seal similar to a normal weapon. When an enhancement gem or seal is applied to this item it confers this bonus to any weapon currently held in that hand; including unarmed strikes and natural weapons if they are with that hand. Weapons thrown with this glove (improvised or not) retain their enhancement bonus until the attack with them resolves.<br><br>The enhancement bonus and special abilities of these gloves overwrite the enhancement bonus and special abilities of the weapons held even if they would be better. The wearer of these gloves may choose to suppress or resume their effects as a reaction.
