effect: The wearer of these goggles may activate them as a 1 AP action to grant themselves greater darkvision with a range of 30 feet; if the wearer already possesses greater darkvision, this improves their existing darkvision by an additional 30 feet. If the wearer possesses darkvision but not greater, their darkvision improves by 30 feet, but only in conditions their darkvision would normally be able to see in. This effect lasts for a number of hours per day equal to the wearer’s Psyche modifier (minimum 2). The wearer may always choose to deactivate the goggles using an additional 1 AP action, allowing the wearer to resume their function later.
