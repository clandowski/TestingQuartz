effect: This helm is a favorite of cavern explorers and miners as when activated as a 2 AP action, it begins to shine light as a torch. This helm may be overloaded to cause it to shine blinding light momentarily to attempt to blind creatures in a 15 foot cone, making a Physical save attack at a +3 bonus. A successful save attack causes the creatures to become blinded for 1d4+1 rounds, and dazzled for 1 round thereafter. If the save attack fails by less than one degree the creatures are instead dazzled for 1 round.<br><br>This overload may only occur a number of times per day equal to the wearer’s Psyche modifier; afterwards the helm ceases to emit light for 1d6+1 rounds minus the wearer’s Psyche modifier (minimum 1).
