The monocle attempts to identify the creature allowing the wearer to roll again with a circumstance bonus to the check equal to the wearer’s Psyche modifier; despite the previous failure. This ability may only be used once per knowledge check and cannot be used to re-attempt the same knowledge check an additional time after the first retry.
