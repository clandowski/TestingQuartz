effect: This set of two monocles may be activated to allow the wearer to see through the eyes of the other monocle. When worn together by the same creature they provide no benefit, but when worn by separate creatures they allow each creature to see what the other sees up to 1,200 feet away. Each wearer may as a reaction aid another on perception and sense motive checks made while sharing vision; each wearer may only use this a number of times per day equal to their Psyche modifier (minimum 2).
