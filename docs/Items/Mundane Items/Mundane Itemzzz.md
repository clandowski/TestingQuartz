| Adamantine Manacles | 10000 GP | 2 lbs.  | These manacles can be utilized to bind a creature instead of a rope when tying up a creature using grapple. Instead of using 20+the MSB of the creature that tied them up, the manacles are treated as if the creature had a different MSB value, varying on the quality and material of the manacles. As per a tie-up of a pin a natural 20 does not automatically escape the bonds of the manacles, meaning if the creature is unable to meet or surpass this value they cannot escape these manacles. Adamantine manacles are treated as if the character had a MSB of 25 (requiring 45 to escape). Adamantine manacles have a hardness of 20 and 5 hit points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Armor Patch Kit     | 10 GP    | 3 lbs.  | This kit contains sturdy stitching materials, adhesives, and patches of leather and chain that can be used to plug up holes, mend tears, and hold together armor that has been put to the test and come out the other side worse for wear.<br><br>An armor patch kit may be applied during a short rest. A creature cannot apply an armor patch kit to armor that it is currently wearing, but may apply one to armor worn by another creature without removing it. When a creature applies an armor patch kit, it must make a Profession skill check (armorsmith, leatherworker, or weaver, as appropriate for the type of armor being repaired) with a DC of 10 + the armorâ€™s AC bonus (using the lower value if the armor has the broken condition); on a failure, the armor patch kit is wasted.<br><br>If an armor patch kit is applied to armor with the broken condition, it is restored to half its hit points + 1. If an armor patch kit is applied to armor that is damaged but does not have the broken condition, it regains 1d8 hit points. For each degree of success on the Profession check, increase the hit points regained by 1d8 (this includes if the armor was initially broken). |
| Basic Whetstone     | 1 GP     | 1 lbs.  | A whetstone allows you to sharpen a blade. When applied to a slashing or piercing melee weapon it allows the weapon to ignore up to 1 point of natural armor an enemy possesses. This effect only lasts for the next 10 attacks made with the weapon, after which it must be sharpened again. Sharpening a weapon takes 10 minutes of work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Crowbar             | 2 GP     | 5 lbs.  | A durable metal tool primarily used to help pry objects open. This item provides a +2 circumstance bonus on strength checks made to force open a door, chest, or similar object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Field Surgery Kit   | 50 GP    | 1 lbs.  | This bulky pouch is usually worn on the belt or with a strap over the shoulder, and contains a collection of bandages, styptics, needles, thread and other useful supplies for adventurers needing to tend to injuries in the field. The supplies themselves are relatively easy to come by and inexpensive to replace, but the watertight pouch is designed to keep them clean, dry, and easily accessible. When making a Medic check, it takes no additional action to use supplies from a field surgery kit.<br><br>A field surgery kit contains enough supplies for 10 uses before needing to be replenished, a process which takes at least 1 hour and access to common supplies such as clean, dry cloth to tear into strips for making bandages.<br><br>When attempting a Medic check to Provide First Aid, Provide Long-Term Care, or Treat Deadly Wounds, expending a use from a field surgery kit grants a +2 equipment bonus to the check.<br><br>A creature may instead expend two uses from the field surgery kit when attempting a Medic check to Treat Deadly Wounds to add its Wisdom modifier to the hit points restored an additional time for each degree of success.                |
| Hammock             | 1 GP     | 2 lbs.  | A blanket or net attached to ropes, allowing it to be gun from a branch or two trees to sleep above the ground. Climbing into or out of a hammock is a 4 AP action. A creature may make a DC 10 acrobatics check to attempt to climb out of the hammock as a 2 AP action, but failure causes the creature to fall out of the hammock and fall prone. The price of the hammock increases by 1 gp per size category above medium.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Iron Manacles       | 50 GP    | 2 lbs.  | These manacles can be utilized to bind a creature instead of a rope when tying up a creature using grapple. Instead of using 20+the MSB of the creature that tied them up, the manacles are treated as if the creature had a different MSB value, varying on the quality and material of the manacles. As per a tie-up of a pin a natural 20 does not automatically escape the bonds of the manacles, meaning if the creature is unable to meet or surpass this value they cannot escape these manacles. Iron manacles are treated as if the character had a MSB of 10 (requiring 30 to escape). Iron manacles have a hardness of 10 and 5 hit points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Medicine Pouch      | 1 GP     | 1 lbs.  | This small pouch contains a honeycomb-like wooden frame that divides it into 8 small compartments, each large enough to hold a potion or other small vial or flask. The wooden frame protects the contents from jostling and sudden impacts, and the wearer never needs to worry about the contents being damaged from ordinary activity unless the pouch is the target of a Sunder combat maneuver or is otherwise dealt damage directly.<br><br>Retrieving an item from a medicine pouch is a 1 AP action, but if the wearer possesses the Quick Draw feat or a similar ability retrieving an item is a free action that can be combined with its activation (such as making a Medic skill check, administering a drug, or applying poison to a weapon).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Milliary Saddle     | 25 GP    | 30 lbs. | A combat-ready saddle allows the rider a 75% chance to stay mounted when knocked unconscious while riding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Mithral Manacles    | 2000 GP  | 1 lbs.  | These manacles can be utilized to bind a creature instead of a rope when tying up a creature using grapple. Instead of using 20+the MSB of the creature that tied them up, the manacles are treated as if the creature had a different MSB value, varying on the quality and material of the manacles. As per a tie-up of a pin a natural 20 does not automatically escape the bonds of the manacles, meaning if the creature is unable to meet or surpass this value they cannot escape these manacles. Mithral manacles are treated as if the character had a MSB of 20 (requiring 40 to escape). Mithral manacles have a hardness of 15 and 5 hit points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Pack Saddle         | 10 GP    | 20 lbs. | A saddle made primarily to hold gear and supplies rather than a rider, allowing it to hold as much weight and gear as the mount can carry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Steel Manacles      | 200 GP   | 2 lbs.  | These manacles can be utilized to bind a creature instead of a rope when tying up a creature using grapple. Instead of using 20+the MSB of the creature that tied them up, the manacles are treated as if the creature had a different MSB value, varying on the quality and material of the manacles. As per a tie-up of a pin a natural 20 does not automatically escape the bonds of the manacles, meaning if the creature is unable to meet or surpass this value they cannot escape these manacles. Steel manacles are treated as if the character had a MSB of 15 (requiring 35 to escape).

| Weapon Cords        | 1 GP     | 1 lbs.  | Weapon cords are 5 foot long leather straps, or metal chains, that may be attached to a weapon and to your wrist. If you drop your weapon or you are disarmed you may recover it as a reaction on your turn and may never move further away than the maximum length of the cord.<br><br>A weapon cord may also be used to make throw weapon attack with easy retrieval. When throwing a weapon you may throw the weapon up to the maximum length of the weapon cord squares away, doing so resolves the attack as normal and allows the weapon to be immediately retrieved as a free action. Weapon cords may be up to 15 feet long but incur an additional 10 gp cost for every 5 feet beyond the normal 5 foot length. Cords beyond 15 feet become too heavy and unwieldy to effectively throw a weapon with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Wooden Torch        | 1 GP     | 1 lbs.  | A torch when lit sheds normal light within a 20 foot radius, raising the light level by one step for 20 feet beyond this (darkness becomes dim light, dim light becomes normal). This cannot raise the light level beyond normal.<br><br>A torch is normally composed of the wooden handle and a flammable material attached to the end, intended to burn slowly, leaving the handle relatively untouched, allowing continual burning for 1 hour before more material must be applied. Lighting a torch takes at least 30 seconds, though can be sped up if another source of flame is nearby.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Wrist Sheath        | 1 GP     | 1 lbs.  | A sheath designed to be strapped to oneâ€™s forearm and hidden under a long sleeve. It can hold one item such as a dagger, flask, potion, or even up to five arrows or bolts. As a reaction you can bend your wrist to cause some or all items contained within to drop into your hand (without provoking attacks of opportunity). This item grants a +2 bonus to sleight of hand to conceal an item in a wrist sheath. A creature with quick draw or similar ability can retrieve items as a free action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
