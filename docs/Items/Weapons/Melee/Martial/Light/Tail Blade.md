additonal_effects: This weapon is only usable by races with a tail, or creatures with the mixed blood race feat with a race with a tail. When equipped races may make attacks with that tail (even if they wouldn't normally have a tail slap natural weapon), though using the statistics of the Tail Blade. Unlike a tail slap the Tail Blade is not treated as a natural weapon; and cannot use the tail slap over the Tail Blade while it is equipped.
description: A weapon designed by tailed races. Even if the race lacks a tail slap or an otherwise prehensile tail, some races have learned to utilize momentum and swipes with their tail with the tail blade equipped as another weapon.
