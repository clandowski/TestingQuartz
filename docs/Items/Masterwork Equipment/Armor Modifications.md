| Armor Spikes        | The armor gains the razored property if it did not already possess it, if the armor already possessed this feature, treat the armor as if it already had this feature selected once for determining the effects of taking this modification additional times.<br><br>Selecting this modification a second causes its effects to apply anytime a creature strikes the wearer with a melee attack using an unarmed strike, natural weapon, or an unarmed touch attack rather than only when the creature misses by 5 or fewer.<br><br>Selecting this modification a third time allows the wearer to use their armor spikes offensively, allowing them to make attack rolls with it as if it were a light simple weapon with the light and blade keywords, deals 1d4 damage and with a crit of 20 x2. This uses the armor’s enhancement bonus for determining enhancement bonuses to attack and damage and may have weapon special abilities applied to it separately from the armor’s special abilities. | 1         |
