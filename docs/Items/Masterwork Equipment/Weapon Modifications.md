The hilt may store up to 3 doses of any liquid; as a reaction the wielder may press a switch on the weapon to cause the liquid inside to coat the weapon. If the weapon gains the broken condition all the contents within are immediately drained onto the ground and can no longer be utilized to coat the blade.<br><br>If utilized with poison this causes the weapon to be treated as if it had a dose of poison applied to it (without the usual risk of poisoning oneself).<br><br>If utilized with other liquids (such as holy water), these coat the weapon and only have effect on a hit with the weapon if the liquid would normally have an effect on contact or injury of another creature. The liquid can potentially damage the weapon if it would normally be capable of damaging it (such as a highly potent acid being stored). Unless the liquid would normally last longer when applied to a weapon, liquids used in this way last for 1 minute or the next successful attack with the weapon (whichever comes first).<br><br>For each masterwork rank above uncommon the weapon may store one additional dose of liquid. | 2         |

The wielder may always choose to alter the weapon by more than one step as part of the 1 AP action utilized to reduce or expand it, rather than needing to spend additional AP to do so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 1         |
| Scoped            | This modification may only be applied to trigger keyword ranged weapons.<br><br>When making a focused attack with the modified ranged weapon you reduce the penalty for firing beyond the first range increment by 1 for each increment beyond the first (minimum 0). This only applies to the focused attack and not any extra or additional attacks made as part of the focused attack.<br><br>You may select this modification a second time you increase the maximum number of range increments you may fire the weapon by 50% (usually improving from 10 to 15).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 1         |

If the weapon already possessed the serrated feature it instead improves the base bleed damage to 1d4+1.<br><br>This modification may be taken twice if the weapon did not originally possess the serrated weapon feature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 1         |
| Softening         | This modification may only be applied to melee weapons that deal bludgeoning damage.<br><br>After successfully striking or sundering an object, the object's hardness is reduced by 5 until the start of your next turn; this applies after damage against the object has resolved. This modification does not stack with itself or other instances of the softening modification. When striking a larger object (such as a wall) only the portion struck is affected rather than the entire structure. The hardness of the object is reduced by an additional 1 per masterwork rank above uncommon the weapon possesses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 2         |
| Weighted Head     | This modification may only be applied to melee weapons that deal bludgeoning damage.<br><br>The weapon deals an additional 50% of the userâ€™s strength modifier on weapon damage rolls. This effectively improves one-handed bludgeoning weapons to 1.5x strength modifier, and two-handed bludgeoning weapons to 2x strength modifier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 2         |
