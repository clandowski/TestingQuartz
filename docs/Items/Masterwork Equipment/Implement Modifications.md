| Durable(Implement)   | The implement gains an additional 3 hit points. This may be selected more than once; for every 2 times it's been applied to the weapon the implementâ€™s hardness also improves by 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 1         |
| Reservoir(Implement) | The implement is hollowed out to allow the storage of potions or other liquids. The implement may only hold one dose of a liquid at a time, but while held allows the wielder to drink or pour out its contents. When pouring the contents of the Implement the wielder may choose to do so within their own square or an adjacent square as a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity. | 1         |
