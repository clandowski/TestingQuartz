| Bloodthirsty                         | +2     | Armor with the bloodthirsty special ability treats its enhancement bonus to AC as 1 higher for 1 round after its wearer deals damage with a melee attack. If the wearer of a suit of bloodthirsty armor is also raging, the armor’s enhancement bonus increases by 3 instead.<br><br>Only light armor can be enchanted with the bloodthirsty special ability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Brawling                             | +3     | The wearer of brawling armor gains a +2 bonus on unarmed strike and natural weapon's attack and damage rolls, including combat maneuver checks made to grapple. Her unarmed strikes and natural weapons count as magic weapons for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. The brawling ability cannot be applied to heavy armor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Defiant                              | +1     | Armor with this special ability excels at blocking the attacks of certain types of creatures, similar to a bane weapon’s excelling against certain foes. Against the designated foe, the item’s enhancement bonus to AC is +2 better than its actual bonus and provides DR 2/— against attacks from that foe. This increase in enhancement bonus applies only to the armor’s enhancement bonus.<br><br>You may perform a ritual to re-attune an existing defiant enchantment to a new creature type. You must spend one week, focusing at least 8 hours each day, and make a DC 10 knowledge check appropriate to identify the new creature type, to then attune the defiant enchantment to a new creature type. |
| Energy Resistance                    | +1     | A suit of armor with this special ability protects against one type of elemental damage type and is designed with patterns depicting the element it protects against. The armor grants Resist 2 against the chosen element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Fortification                        | +1     | Armor with this special ability protects vital areas of the wearer against critical hits or precision damage against the wearer. A wearer struck by either has a 25% chance to negate the effect and instead force the damage to be rolled normally without the critical hit or precision damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Fortification, Heavy                 | +5     | Armor with this special ability protects vital areas of the wearer against critical hits or precision damage against the wearer. A wearer struck by either has a 75% chance to negate the effect and instead force the damage to be rolled normally without the critical hit or precision damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Fortification, Improved              | +3     | Armor with this special ability protects vital areas of the wearer against critical hits or precision damage against the wearer. A wearer struck by either has a 50% chance to negate the effect and instead force the damage to be rolled normally without the critical hit or precision damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Ghost Touch                          | +2     | Armor with this special ability allows its armor bonus to be applied against the attacks of both corporeal and incorporeal creatures. In addition the armor may be worn and interacted with by incorporeal creatures, while still retaining the ability to freely pass through solid objects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Greater Energy Resistance            | +3     | A suit of armor with this special ability protects against one type of elemental damage type and is designed with patterns depicting the element it protects against. The armor grants Resist 4 against the chosen element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Guardian                             | +1     | The wearer of armor with this special ability may transfer some or all of the armor’s enhancement bonus to their saving throws as an untyped bonus. As a free action at the start of the wearer’s turn the wearer may choose how to allocate the armor’s enhancement bonus. This bonus lasts until the start of their next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Improved Energy Resistance, Improved | +2     | A suit of armor with this special ability protects against one type of elemental damage type and is designed with patterns depicting the element it protects against. The armor grants Resist 3 against the chosen element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Lifesurge                            | +2     | Lifesurge armor boosts and sustains the wielder’s life energy while he is in the throes of combat. The wearer gains a bonus on saving throws against ability damage, ability drain, and energy drain equal to the armor's enhancement bonus. In addition, whenever the wielder receives temporary hit points from any source, he adds the armor's enhancement bonus to these temporary hit points; these temporary hit points do not stack with themselves when receiving temporary hit points from multiple sources.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Sensing                              | +3     | A set of sensing armor compensates when its wearer has been blinded, is in total darkness (as long as the wearer doesn’t have darkvision or the see in darkness ability), or is in magical darkness (as long as the wearer doesn’t have the see in darkness ability). When one of these conditions affects the wearer, sensing armor immediately grants its wearer blindsight with a 5-foot range and blindsense with a 60-foot range. As soon as the wearer can see, the additional senses end. The wearer can’t gain these abilities by closing her eyes.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Shadow Blending                      | +2     | This effect grants the wearer an additional 20% miss chance to attacks against them in dim light (effectively granting them a 40% miss chance). This doesn’t improve the concealment to total concealment, only improving the miss chance of the concealment provided by dim light.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Stanching                            | +1     | Stanching armor reduces damage caused by bleed effects by an amount equal to the armor’s enhancement bonus. In addition the user adds the armor’s enhancement bonus to tenacity checks to become stable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Titanic                              | +2     | A creature wearing titanic armor is considered one size category larger for the purposes of using, or being targeted by, special attacks that are dependent on size. In addition, once per minute as a free action the wearer can add the armor’s enhancement bonus to a single combat maneuver check, or to their CMD against a single combat maneuver. Because of its great bulk, the strength rating of titanic armor is increased by an amount equal to half its enhancement bonus (minimum 1).                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Unbowed                              | +5     | When the wearer of this armor would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by an attack that dealt hit point damage, the wearer can instead negate all of the attack’s damage as a reaction.
