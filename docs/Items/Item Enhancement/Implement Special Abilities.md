| Extra Affinity | +1     | The implement grants the wielder an additional affinity talent while held; and may be used when assembling spells as part of prepared spellcasters.<br><br>The wielder must be holding the implement to cast a spell he lacks the affinity talent for normally regardless of if he is spontaneous or prepared.<br><br>This special ability may be applied to an implement more than once. |
| Extra Spell    | +1     | The implement grants the wielder access to a single spell (but not talent) while wielded. The caster must have, or the implement must grant, any prerequisite affinity talents in order to cast this spell.<br><br>This special ability may be applied to an implement more than once.                                                                                                    |
| Extra Talent   | +1     | The implement grants the wielder access to a single magic talent but not spell. This talent has no benefit unless the implement or the caster already possesses the prerequisite affinity or spell for the talent to cast it.<br><br>This special ability may be applied to an implement more than once.                                                                                  |
| Ghost Touch    | +1     | An implement with the ghost touch special ability allows the wielder's spells to deal damage normally against a incorporeal creature, rather than the normal immunity or 50% reduction in damage it would normally provide.<br><br>This special ability may be applied to an implement more than once.                                                                                    |
| Overwhelming   | +3     | An implement with this special ability must also possess the extra affinity special ability. An implement with overwhelming treats a creature as having 2 lower resist against the element matching the implement’s affinity(s) for determining their damage reduction and bonus to saves against that element.                                                                           |
| Spell Piercing | +1     | You may add the implement’s enhancement bonus to the percentile rolls to overcome spell resistance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
