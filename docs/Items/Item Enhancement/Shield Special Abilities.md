| Defiant    | +1     | Shields with this special ability excel at blocking the attacks of certain types of creatures, similar to a bane weapon’s excelling against certain foes. Against the designated foe, the item’s enhancement bonus to AC is +2 better than its actual bonus and provides DR 2/— against attacks from that foe. This increase in enhancement bonus applies only to the shield’s enhancement bonus.<br><br>You may perform a ritual to re-attune an existing bane enchantment to a new creature type. You must spend one week, focusing at least 8 hours each day, and make a DC 10 knowledge check appropriate to identify the new creature type, to then attune the defiant enchantment to a new creature type. |
| Rebounding | +1     | A rebounding shield provides an additional +2 bonus to AC against thrown weapons; and may add its shield bonus to the wielder's touch AC against splash weapons. If a splash weapon is thrown at the wielder of a rebounding shield and misses, the wielder may choose the square the splash weapon lands in, rather than the usual random location.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
