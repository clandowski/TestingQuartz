| Anchoring                | +2     | This special ability can only be added to a melee weapon. An anchoring weapon pins a target in place and prevents it from moving. As a 1 AP action, the weapon can be fixed in place at a point in space. This ability can also be used when the wielder hits a creature with a melee attack using an anchoring weapon. This anchors the target to the weapon, preventing it from moving away from the weapon. The target is not entangled or paralyzed; it simply cannot move from its location without first destroying the weapon or making a successful DC 30 Strength check as a 4 AP action to move with the weapon up to 10 feet. An anchoring weapon remains motionless and cannot be used to attack while it is anchoring a creature. An anchoring weapon has no effect on amorphous creatures, including elementals, oozes, and creatures in gaseous or liquid form. It also cannot anchor incorporeal creatures unless the weapon also has the ghost touch special ability. |
| Bane                     | +1     | A bane weapon excels against certain foes. When creating a bane special ability select a single creature type; if selecting humanoids or outsiders pick a single subtype as well. Against a designated foe, the weapon’s enhancement bonus is +2 better than its actual bonus (allowing it to go above +5). It also deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against such foes.<br><br>You may perform a ritual to re-attune an existing bane enchantment to a new creature type. You must spend one week, focusing at least 8 hours each day, and make a DC 10 knowledge check appropriate to identify the new creature type, to then attune the bane enchantment to a new creature type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Brilliant Energy         | +4     | A brilliant energy weapon has much if not all of the weapon transformed into light or a near-pure form of energy. Despite this the weapon weighs as much as it usually would. While drawn the weapon sheds light in a 20 foot radius, and ignores all armor and shield bonuses to AC a creature possesses (including any enhancement bonuses their armor or shield may possess); all other bonuses to AC still apply as normal. This type of weapon does not harm undead, objects, or constructs; but still harms living constructs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Called                   | +1     | A creature possessing a called weapon may attune with a weapon at the beginning of each day. Once attune the creature may teleport the weapon to themselves from up to 100 feet away as a reaction. The creature does not need line of sight or line of effect, but effects that would interfere with teleportation prevent the return of a called weapon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Defending                | +1     | As a free action, at the start of the wielder’s turn, the creature may choose to transfer the weapons enhancement bonus to their AC. This bonus is treated as a untyped bonus that stacks with all others. This bonus to AC lasts until the start of their next turn.<br><br>This special ability may be placed on melee weapons, but not shields.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Designating              | +2     | A creature struck by a designating weapon grants the wielder’s allies a +2 morale bonus on melee attack and damage rolls against the target for 1 round. Multiple attacks against the same target does not increase the bonus or duration, though multiple creatures may be affected by a designated weapon at once.<br><br>This special ability can only be placed on ranged weapons or ammunition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Designating, Greater     | +4     | A creature struck by a designating weapon grants the wielder’s allies a +4 morale bonus on melee attack and damage rolls against the target for 1 round.

| Distance                 | +1     | A weapon with the distance special ability have double the range increment the weapon would normally possess. This increases the range increment of ranged weapons, thrown weapons, and even improvised thrown weapons if they would possess this special ability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Elemental Fury           | +1     | When creating an Elemental Fury select a single elemental damage type. As a free action you may activate or deactivate the elemental effect upon the weapon, remaining activated until deactivated again. While active the weapon blazes with elemental energy dealing an extra 1d6 points of damage of the chosen elemental type on a successful hit. The elemental effect covering the weapon does not harm the wielder. Even if choosing a different element you may not apply elemental fury more than once to a single weapon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

If the creature is using two-weapon fighting with two weapons with the speed enhancement, each weapon individually gains one bonus attack, as these effects are applied separately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Spell Storing            | +1     | A spell storing weapon allows a spellcaster to store a single targeted spell of up to 6 BCB in the weapon. (The spell must have a casting time of 4 AP or less) Anytime the weapon strikes a creature and the creature takes damage from it, the weapon can immediately cast the spell on that creature as a free action if the wielder desires. Once the spell has been cast from the weapon, a spellcaster can cast another spell into it. The weapon magically imparts to the wielder the name of the spell currently stored within it. This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Sticky                   | +1     | This special ability can be placed only on reach weapons, piercing melee weapons, and weapons with the flail or unarmed keyword.<br><br>When a sticky weapon scores a critical hit against a target, instead of rolling to confirm the critical threat, the wielder can deal normal damage and attempt a steal combat maneuver check against the target of the attack. This combat maneuver doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity, and the wielder gains a +2 bonus on the combat maneuver check. If the weapon is a x3 crit multiplier they instead gain a +4 bonus on the check, and if the weapon is a x4 crit multiplier they gain a +6.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Summoning Bane           | +1     | A summon bane weapon excels against summoned creatures, including those summoned by conjuration keyword spells. Against such summoned creatures, the weapon’s enhancement bonus is +2 better than its normal bonus. It also deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against such foes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Vampiric                 | +1     | This special ability can be placed only on piercing or slashing melee weapons.<br><br>The first time each round that the wielder hits a living target with a vampiric weapon, the weapon grants an amount of temporary hit points to the wielder equal to 10% the damage dealt to the target, to a maximum equal to twice the welder's hit dice. Temporary hit points gained through this effect expire at the start of the wielder’s next turn and do not stack with themselves.<br><br>If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points or fewer with a vampiric weapon, the wielder is healed for ½ the damage dealt to the creature as part of the attack. This ability cannot heal the wielder above half his total hit points, and has no effect when used against creatures with less than half the wielder’s hit dice.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Vampiric, Greater        | +2     | This special ability can be placed only on piercing or slashing melee weapons.<br><br>The first time each round that the wielder hits a living target with a vampiric weapon, the weapon grants an amount of temporary hit points to the wielder equal to ½ the damage dealt to the target, to a maximum equal to twice the welder's hit dice. Temporary hit points gained through this effect expire at the start of the wielder’s next turn and do not stack with themselves.<br><br>If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points or fewer with a vampiric weapon, the wielder is instead healing for an amount equal to what he would have gained in temporary hit points, with any excess healing over its maximum hit point total applied as temporary hit points with the same duration. This has no effect when used against creatures with less than half the wielder’s hit dice.                                                                                                  |
| Vicious                  | +1     | A vicious weapon creates a small eruption of energy when it strikes a target.
