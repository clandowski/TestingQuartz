Metal gloves, boots, or similar items. A creature wearing these is treated as having improved unarmed strike for the purposes of determining if they would provoke when making an unarmed strike. A gauntlet may be made of leather or metal. Specialty pieces may be made to enhance other body parts (such as feet, elbows, knees, ect) behaving similarly to gauntlets/greaves.
