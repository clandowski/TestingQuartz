A small parrying shield, a buckler is the lightest of shields. Used best in a dueling environment and held in one hand. It does not offer as great of protection, but it is also easy to carry. Similar to a buckler, this weapon deals piercing damage instead of bludgeoning damage when used to make a shield bash.
