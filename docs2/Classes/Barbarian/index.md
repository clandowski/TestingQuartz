## Class Features


The following are class features of the barbarian. 

#### Weapon and Armor Proficiency

A barbarian is proficient with all simple weapons and armor. If this is the character’s first level in a class he gains proficiency in all martial weapons and light martial armor.

#### [Stamina](https://niched20.miraheze.org/wiki/Martial_Classes "Martial Classes") (Ex)

At 1st level, a barbarian gains access to a pool of stamina points that allow him to perform feats of strength and agility. This pool contains a number of stamina points equal to his Constitution modifier plus levels in martial classes (minimum 1). This pool replenishes once per day after a long rest.

#### Powerful Strikes (Ex)

If this is the character’s first level in a martial class, the barbarian may gain Power Stance or Reckless Stance as a bonus feat.

#### Rage (Ex)

A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting him additional combat prowess. Starting at 1st level, a barbarian can spend 1 point of stamina to rage for 1 minute. A barbarian can enter rage as a free action.

While in rage, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus to his Attack and Damage rolls. In addition, he takes a –2 penalty to Armor Class. In addition at the beginning of each turn the Barbarian gains 4 temporary hit points plus an additional temporary hit point per level of barbarian he possesses; these temporary hit points last for 1 round or until the barbarian’s rage ends. While in rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration (such as taking a 10 or 20, or casting a spell).

A barbarian can end his rage as a free action and is fatigued after raging for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. A barbarian cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a barbarian falls unconscious, his rage immediately ends.

At 3rd level the barbarian may spend an additional stamina when his rage is about to end, to instead allow it to continue for an additional minute. The barbarian may do this once per rage plus an additional time for every 6 levels after 3rd. These continued rounds of rage stack with the original for the purposes of determining how long the barbarian would be fatigued at the end of this rage. Allowing the rage to continue does not refill the barbarian’s fury pool, and must still be refilled as normal.

At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter the barbarian’s bonus to attack and damage increases by an additional 1 while raging. Starting at 15th level, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his rage.

#### Barbaric Vitality (Ex)

At 1st level, a barbarian becomes more sturdy than others treating their constitution as 2 higher points per level of barbarian he possesses for the purposes of determining when he dies from hit point damage.

In addition the barbarian may select a single strength based skill, constitution based skill, or intimidate. The barbarian gains ranks in this select skill equal to his levels in barbarian.

#### Barbaric Path (Ex)

While a barbarian may not have a graceful approach to problems, a barbarian still grows as a combatant as he gains levels, learning additional tricks and techniques. Starting at 2nd level and every two barbarian levels thereafter, a barbarian gains a barbaric path.

For a complete listing of barbaric paths see Table: Barbaric Paths.

#### Fury (Ex)

At 3rd level a barbarian learns to channel his rage in new and destructive ways. While raging the barbarian gains a pool of fury equal to his constitution modifier (minimum 1). This pool empties at the end of a rage and fills each time the barbarian enters a new rage. If an ability would cost the barbarian more fury than a barbarian has in maximum fury, and his fury pool is currently full, he may still use the ability but takes 2 points of nonlethal damage for every 1 point of fury beyond his maximum the ability cost; this does not allow the barbarian to go beyond their maximum fury for abilities with variable fury costs. The barbarian may spend 1 stamina as a move action on his turn to refill his Fury pool without requiring him to enter a new rage.

#### Aggression (Ex)

At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter the barbarian gains an aggression allowing him to tap further into the potential of his rage and fury. Unless otherwise noted aggressions can only be used if the barbarian is raging.  If a Agression talent calls for a save attack the save attack is made at 1d20 + ½ MPB + Constitution modifier unless specified otherwise. They may add the enhancement bonus of a wielded weapon to this save attack.

For a complete listing of aggressions see Table: Aggressions.

#### Barbaric Bond (Ex/Su)

At 5th level the barbarian expands his capabilities in a number of ways. He barbarian choses one of the following packages gaining its benefits.

For a complete listing of barbaric bonds see Table: Barbaric Bonds.

#### Vigor (Ex)

At 7th level, once per day the barbarian may spend a reaction to empty his current fury pool, gaining a number of temporary hit points equal to twice the number of fury points spent in this way; this ability may be used in response to taking damage, and temporary hit points gained through this ability last until the start of the barbarian’s next turn. At 12th level and every 5 levels thereafter the barbarian may use this ability an additional time per day.

#### Savagery (Ex/Su)

At 9th, 13th, and 17th level the barbarian selects a savagery that represents his bloodline, tribe, beliefs, or connection to another power. Unless otherwise specified, savagries do not require the barbarian to be raging to receive their benefits. If a savagery calls for a save attack the save attack is made at 1d20 + ½ MPB + Constitution modifier unless specified otherwise. They may add the enhancement bonus of a wielded weapon to this save attack.

For a complete listing of savagries see Table: Savageries.

#### Unstoppable (Ex)

At 20th level, the barbarian becomes nearly unkillable. The barbarian gains DR 5/- and energy resistance 1 to acid, cold, electricity, and fire damage; if the barbarian already possesses DR or energy resistance from their race or a barbarian class feature, instead increase it by 1. Finally while raging the barbarian gains regeneration 5, and the barbarian’s rage does not end even if knocked unconscious or dead, though it still only lasts up to its maximum number of rounds and may not be refreshed if unconscious or dead.

| Arcane Defiance (Su) | Barbarian 7th  | Once per round the barbarian may spend 1 fury to gain 5% spell resistance as an reaction when targeted by a spell. The barbarian must be aware of the caster at the time this ability is used. The barbarian may choose to spend additional fury when using this ability to gain additional spell resistance, though cannot gain more than 50% spell resistance in a single use. At 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter the barbarian gains 5 more spell resistance per fury spent. This spell resistance lasts until the start of the barbarian's next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Bloody Impale (Ex)   | \-             | The barbarian may attempt to punch through a creature’s flesh to damage its vital organs. When the barbarian confirms a critical hit he may as a free action spend 1 fury to make a fortitude save attack against the opponent. On a success the target takes 1d4 points of strength, constitution, or dexterity damage (chosen by the barbarian).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Breaker (Ex)         | \-             | The barbarian may spend 1 point of fury as part of a melee attack against an object or performing a sunder combat maneuver to add his barbarian level to the damage roll (a failed maneuver still spends this fury). The barbarian may not use this ability if sundering natural weapons or natural armor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Chase (Ex)           | \-             | Once per round the barbarian may spend 1 fury as an reaction to move up to double his speed. He may only use this ability when a foe within his reach uses a withdraw action to move away from him; and his movement must end adjacent to the creature that used the withdraw action. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Clarity (Ex)         | \-             | You may spend 1 fury as a free action at the beginning of your turn while raging; until the beginning of your next turn you no longer have a restriction on what actions can be performed during a rage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Flesh Wound          | \-             | The barbarian may spend 1 fury per 2 points of damage he takes to convert an equal amount of that damage to nonlethal damage. He may convert an additional point of damage per fury for every 5 levels of barbarian he possesses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Hurling (Ex)         | \-             | As a full-round action while raging, the barbarian can spend 1 point of fury lift and hurl an object up to one size category smaller than himself with both hands or two size categories smaller with one hand as an improvised thrown weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. This inflicts 1d6 damage plus an additional 1d6 per size category above tiny This damage is halved if the object is not made of stone, metal, or similar material. Even if using a weapon with this ability the barbarian does not use the statistics of the weapon for this attack (damage dice, crit, keywords, etc..) as its is treated as an improvised thrown weapon regardless; enhancement bonuses to hit and damage may apply as normal. <br><br> The barbarian may spend 2 fury to reduce this to a standard action. |
| Mighty Chop (Ex)     |                | The barbarian may spend 2 fury to make a focused attack action. This attack deals additional damage equal to his levels in barbarian and he increases the critical multiplier of his weapon by 1 for this attack. At 11th level the barbarian may spend 5 fury to instead add twice his barbarian level to this damage roll and increase the crit range and crit multiplier by 1; this range increase is applied after any multipliers to critical range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Mighty Swing (Ex)    | Barbarian 7th  | The barbarian may spend 2 fury as an reaction when a critical threat is determined to automatically confirm the critical hit.

| Raze (Ex)            | Barbarian 11th | The barbarian may spend 3 fury as a full-round action; the barbarian causes such destruction around him that all creatures within 30 feet of him take 1d8 damage per two barbarian levels he possesses plus his constitution modifier. Creatures within this area may make a reflex save for half damage (against 1d20 + ½ MPB + Constitution modifier)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Rising Swing (Ex)    | Barbarian 7th  | You make an upwards swing going under the foe’s guard and potentially unbalancing them. The barbarian may spend 2 fury to make a focused attack action. The fighter rolls his attack as normal, but the foe must make a sense motive check against this attack roll, if it fails to exceed this attack the foe is treated as if you had successfully used feint on that foe before this attack. In addition feats that modify feint (besides changing the action required to use it) may be applied to this feint attempt (such as Greater feint increasing the duration of the feint effect).                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Savage Accuracy (Ex) | \-             | The barbarian may spend 1 point of fury as a reaction to gain a +1 bonus on his next attack roll made before the end of his next turn. This bonus increases by +1 for every 4 levels of barbarian.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Savage Blow (Ex)     | \-             | The barbarian may spend 1 point of fury as a reaction to gain a +1 bonus on his next damage roll made before the end of his next turn.

| Savage Grapple (Ex)  | \-             | The barbarian may spend 1 point of fury when making an attack with an unarmed strike or natural weapon (thus a failed attack roll still spends this fury); if the attack is successful the barbarian may attempt to grapple that creature as a free action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Shockwave Sweep (Ex) | \-             | The barbarian swings his weapon with such force it causes a shockwave to emanate out from him. The barbarian may spend 2 fury as a standard action to damage all foes within a 15 foot cone, dealing the barbarian’s weapon damage plus an additional 1d6 damage per three barbarian levels (with a damage type of the weapon used with this ability). Creatures within this area are subject to a reflex save attack. A failed save attack deals half damage. At 5th level this improves to a 30 foot cone, and at 12th it becomes a 60 foot cone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Shove (Ex)           | \-             | The barbarian may spend 1 fury to make a reposition attempt in place of a melee attack (using the base attack bonus of the replaced attack). If he succeeds the creature takes damage equal to his strength modifier and is subject to a reposition attempt (choosing to move with the creature or not as normal). At 11th level the barbarian may add any enhancement bonuses to his armor’s AC to this combat maneuver attempt and the damage of this ability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Spell Sunder (Su)    | Barbarian 7th  | The barbarian may spend 5 fury to attempt to destroy an ongoing spell with the sheer power of his rage. The barbarian may make a combat maneuver check against a spell. For any effect not on a creature he must succeed at a normal sunder combat maneuver against 15 + the effect’s BCB. To sunder a spell on a creature, the barbarian must succeed at a normal sunder combat maneuver against the creature treating their CMD roll as 5 higher (ignoring any miss chance caused by a spell). If successful the barbarian may suppress the effect for 1 round plus an additional round for every 5 the barbarian exceeds the creature’s CMD.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Sudden Strike (Ex)   | Barbarian 7th  | When a foe moves into any square threatened by the barbarian he may spend 2 fury to make an attack of opportunity against that foe, even if that movement would not normally provoke an attack of opportunity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Mounted Fury  | Ex   | The barbarian gains the service of a mount. It gains a companion as described on the companion page treating your levels in barbarian -3 as your spell prowess bonus to determine the progression of this companion (and stacks with spell prowess bonus gained from other sources). The animal companion gained this way must select the quadruped or serpentine base form. It gains the animal type as its companion type. In addition the animal companion begins with the Altered Size (Large Size) and Mount companion talents. The companion gains these types and talents even if the barbarian does not meet the prerequisites.<br><br>While companions can take many forms a barbarian’s animal companion should usually have a form similar to that of a beast (wolf, tiger, boar, horse, etc..) though the GM may allow for other creatures. If a barbarian releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This is treated similarly to the ranger's animal companion class feature when determining what classes and sources this companion may receive talents from.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Death Bond    | Ex   | The barbarian becomes more powerful the more danger he is in and the closer to death he becomes. When the barbarian is reduced below half health while raging he may activate this ability as a free action, even if it is not his turn. While active this ability grants the barbarian an additional +1 bonus to hit and +2 bonus to damage rolls; but he no longer gains his usual temporary hit points per round when raging. When the barbarian is reduced below one quarter his maximum health this bonus improves to +2 bonus to hit and +4 bonus to damage rolls If the barbarian is reduced to 0 hit points or lower this bonus improves to +3 bonus to hit and +6 bonus to damage rolls as long as the barbarian would be capable of acting while at 0 or lower. At 10th level the barbarian may act as normal for 1 round as if he wasn’t at 0 hit points or lower, plus an additional round every 5 levels thereafter. This means the barbarian is not disabled by the effect nor does he take damage for performing actions while in this state; this does not allow the barbarian to act if killed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Animal Aspect | Su   | The barbarian forms a bond with nature becoming more bestial in form. While raging the barbarian’s penalty to AC increases by an additional 2, but he gains a +1 bonus to natural armor (or increases his existing bonus to natural armor by 1). In addition he gains an additional +2 bonus to Strength and Dexterity while raging. At 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter this natural armor improves by an additional 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Tribal Bond   | Ex   | The barbarian becomes a strong leading figure and learns to inspire his allies with his courage. While raging, all allies within 30 feet of the barbarian (excluding the barbarian himself) gain a +2 morale bonus on attack, MSB, and damage rolls. At 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter this morale bonus improves by an additional 1. In addition, while raging the barbarian may spend 1 fury as a 1 AP action to grant all allies affected by this ability temporary hit points equal to the temporary hit points granted by his rage ability until the start of your next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Mounted Fury  | Ex   | The barbarian gains the service of a mount. It gains a companion as described on the companion page treating your levels in barbarian -3 as your spell prowess bonus to determine the progression of this companion (and stacks with spell prowess bonus gained from other sources). The animal companion gained this way must select the quadruped or serpentine base form. It gains the animal type as its companion type. In addition the animal companion begins with the Altered Size (Large Size) and Mount companion talents. The companion gains these types and talents even if the barbarian does not meet the prerequisites. While companions can take many forms a barbarian’s animal companion should usually have a form similar to that of a beast (wolf, tiger, boar, horse, etc..) though the GM may allow for other creatures. If a barbarian releases her companion from service or her animal companion perishes, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This is treated similarly to the ranger's animal companion class feature when determining what classes and sources this companion may receive talents from. In addition, when entering a rage, and mounted or adjacent to your mount, you may spend 1 additional stamina to grant the benefits of your rage to your mount. The mount does not gain the benefits of any other features you possess that grant additional effects while raging. |
| Death Bond    | Ex   | The barbarian becomes more powerful the more danger he is in and the closer to death he becomes. When the barbarian is reduced below half health while raging he may activate this ability as a free action, even if it is not his turn. While active this ability grants the barbarian an additional +1 bonus to hit and +2 bonus to damage rolls; but he no longer gains his usual temporary hit points per round when raging. When the barbarian is reduced below one quarter his maximum health this bonus improves to +2 bonus to hit and +4 bonus to damage rolls. If the barbarian is reduced to 0 hit points or lower this bonus improves to +3 bonus to hit and +6 bonus to damage rolls, and gains DR 1/- (this stacks with other untyped DR the barbarian possesses), as long as the barbarian would be capable of acting while at 0 or lower. This DR improves by an additional 1 at 10th and every 5 levels thereafter. At 8th level, nonlethal damage in excess of his maximum nonlethal only converts half of the excess damage into lethal damage rather than the full amount while using this ability. At 10th level the barbarian gains 1 additional AP while at 0 hit points or lower while using this ability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Animal Aspect | Su   | The barbarian forms a bond with nature becoming more bestial in form. While raging the barbarian’s penalty to AC increases by an additional 2, but he gains a +1 bonus to natural armor (or increases his existing bonus to natural armor by 1). In addition he gains an additional +2 bonus to Strength and Agility while raging. At 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter this natural armor improves by an additional 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
