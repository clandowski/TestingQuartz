Allies may end this rage as a free action as normal and are fatigued for the standard duration, otherwise this ability lasts until the end of the barbarian’s rage.

| Elemental Protection (Su)       | Elemental savagery, Barbarian 13th                 | The barbarian gains resist 2 against the type chosen when he took the elemental savagery; if the barbarian already possesses this type of resist from a non-temporary source (such as a race trait or other class feature) he instead improves that resist by 2.

In addition you may spend an reaction when you make a successful critical hit to deal an additional 1d10 damage of your chosen energy type (2d10 for a x3 crit weapon, 3d10 on a x4 crit weapon). If your weapon or attack already deals damage of this type (such as through a magical special ability of the weapon) you improve the damage dice of that and this ability by one step.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Frenzy (Ex)                     | Overwhelming Might savagery, Fury, Barbarian 17th  | You have learned to take your rage even further beyond. Once per day when entering a rage you may instead enter a frenzy. Frenzy grants the same effects as rage and is treated as a rage for all effects that require rage. When in a frenzy you gain an additional +4 bonus to attack and damage rolls, and may make one additional attack at your highest base attack bonus (this effect does not stack with other effects that grant additional attacks.). You take an additional -2 penalty to AC in addition to the normal effects of rage, and take 2 points of nonlethal damage for each round you remain in frenzy. Finally during this frenzy your fury pool has its maximum capacity doubled. If you wish to end the frenzy early you must make a will save (against 10 + ½ your MPB) once per round as a free action, success ends the frenzy immediately and you are fatigued for 1 minute (this bypasses any immunities to fatigue). During a frenzy the barbarian must attack those he perceives as foes to the best of his ability. Should he run out of enemies before the frenzy expires, the rampage continues, attacking the nearest creature (determined randomly if several creatures are equal distance), and will fight that creature regardless. |

| Storm of Souls (Su)             | Vengeful Spirits savagery, Barbarian 17th          | The barbarian learns to temporarily disperse the souls that cling to him, sending their malevolent energies out.
