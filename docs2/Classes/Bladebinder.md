## Class Features

The following are class features of the fighter.

#### Weapon and Armor Proficiency

A blade binder is proficient with all simple weapons and armor. If this is the character’s first level in a class he gains proficiency in all martial weapons and armor.

#### [Stamina](https://niched20.miraheze.org/wiki/Martial_Classes "Martial Classes") (Ex)

At 1st level, a blade binder gains access to a pool of stamina points that allow him to perform feats of strength and agility. This pool contains a number of stamina points equal to his Endurance modifier plus his levels in martial classes (minimum 1). This pool replenishes once per day after a long rest.
asdfasdf
#### Combat Stance (Ex)

If this is the character’s first level in a martial class, the blade binder gains his choice of Power Stance, Whirlwind Stance, or Skirmisher Stance as a bonus feat.

#### Binder Specialization (Su)  

At 1st level, the blade binder gains access to a specialization that furthers his capabilities, and in some cases enhances more of his energy sources and ki point focus. At 3rd level and every 5 levels thereafter the blade binder gains an additional binder specialization.

For a complete listing of binder specializations, see List - Binder Specializations.

#### Summon Weapon
(Su)  

At 1st level, the blade binder learns to summon a weapon through the combination of his own power and the powers of creation itself. This ability requires a standard action and 1 stamina, summoning the weapon directly into the hands of the blade binder. The summoned weapon must be one the blade binder is proficient with and appropriately sized for him; the shape, size, and type of weapon it will be is chosen at the time of summoning. Once summoned, the blade lasts indefinitely or until the blade leaves his possession for longer than 1 round. Weapons summoned with this ability are summoned with a +1 enhancement bonus.

You may only have 2 weapons plus an additional 1 weapon per 6 blade binder levels you possess summoned at one time. When summoning a combination or double weapon the blade binder must pay 2 stamina to summon it, but doing applies any blade improvements or additional bonuses to both weapons of the weapon without requiring the blade binder to pay a second time. Double weapons and combination weapons count as 2 weapons for the purposes of how many weapons the blade binder currently has summoned. At 2nd level a blade binder may summon two weapons with a single use of summon weapon by increasing the stamina cost by 1.

At 3rd level, upon gaining a Ki Pool the Blade Binder may spend Ki instead of stamina when using this ability. In addition at 3rd level, the blade binder’s summoned weapons gain an additional +1 enhancement bonus (maximum +5) for every 3 MPB he possesses after 1st,  to a maximum of +5.

#### Binder Talent (Su)  

At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter a binder gains the benefits of a binder talent. If a binder talent calls for a save attack the save attack is made at 1d20 + ½ MPB + Psyche modifier unless specified otherwise. They may add the enhancement bonus of a wielded weapon to this save attack.

For a complete listing of binder talents, see Table - Binder Talents.

#### Ki Pool (Su)

At 3rd level, a blade binder gains access to a pool of internal energies called ki, which allow him to perform supernatural feats that go beyond the limits of his physical body. This pool contains a number of ki points equal 1 + his Psyche modifier (minimum 2) and refreshes once per day when the blade binder regains his stamina. A blade binder may spend 1 point of stamina as a free action on his turn to regain 2 points of his ki pool.

As long as the blade binder has at least 1 point in his ki pool, he gains an enhancement bonus on athletics checks to jump equal to his class level, and his unarmed strikes and natural attacks are treated as magic weapons. At 8th level, his unarmed strikes and natural attacks are treated as silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

In addition at 3rd level a blade binder expands his repertoire of his Ki Pool allowing him to spend his ki points in additional ways:

-   Spend a ki point in place of a reaction.
-   Once per round, spend a ki point as a reaction to gain a +4 dodge bonus to AC for 1 round.
-   Once per round, spend a ki point as a reaction to gain a +20 enhancement bonus to athletics checks made to jump for 1 round, and to be considered as having a running start when making such a check.

If a blade binder gains a ki pool from another source, he does not combine the pools for the purposes of determining capacity, nor does he gain an additional ki pool, but may spend points from his ki pool to pay for abilities from either source that require ki points. If each pool requires different ability scores (such as Psyche and Focus) the blade binder may use the higher of the two ability scores when determining the capacity of his ki pool. The blade binder may add together his levels in all classes that grant a ki pool to determine the abilities of his ki pool class feature.

#### Blade Improvement (Su)  

At 3rd level, the blade binder gains 2 blade improvements; allowing him to further customize his summoned weapons. A blade binder must choose to apply a blade improvement at the time of summoning, and must summon a different weapon to apply different blade improvements. A blade binder may only have a maximum of 1 blade improvement plus an additional blade improvement for every 4 levels of blade binder you possess (to a maximum of 6 blade improvements) applied to a single summoned weapon.

A summoned weapon with a blade improvement treats each blade improvement as a +1 bonus worth of magic weapon special ability (+2 or more if a blade improvement counts as more than one blade improvement). If a weapon possesses any magic weapon special abilities from enhancement seals applied to the weapon, in addition to the blade improvements applied to the weapon, beyond +5 are suppressed until the total magic weapon special abilities plus the blade improvements are equal to or lower than +5.

At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter the blade binder gains an additional blade improvement. For every 8 levels after 3rd the blade binder gains a bonus blade improvement in addition to the one he normally gains at that level. If a blade improvement calls for a save attack the save attack is made at 1d20 + ½ MPB + Psyche modifier. They may add the enhancement bonus of a wielded weapon to this save attack.

For a complete listing of blade improvements, see Table - Blade Improvements.

#### Summon Armor (Su)  

At 5th level, the blade binder learns to summon armor you are proficient with. Summoning armor takes a standard action costing 1 Ki pool point. The armor may be summoned directly onto the blade binder as part of summoning. Unless otherwise specified, the blade binder may not apply blade improvement talents to his summoned armor. The blade binder may only have one set of armor summoned at one time, replacing the existing one each time he summons a new one. The armor is summoned at a +1 enhancement bonus, increasing by an additional +1 at 6 MPB and every 3 MPB thereafter. Similar to summoned weapons if the summoned armor leaves the blade binder’s possession for more than 1 round it immediately disappears. The blade binder may only have a single suit of armor summoned at one time.

Unlike normal armor the binder’s summoned armor has a total health pool equal to 15 per blade binder level. This health pool is shared across all his summoned armor; and once depleted he may no longer summon armor for the remainder of the day. This armor health pool cannot be repaired by any magic or mundane means except for blade binder abilities that allow him to restore this health pool. In addition, despite the type of armor his armor’s hardness is always 5 + 1 per 4 blade binder levels.  If the blade binder multiclasses he may count his levels in non-blade binder classes as ½ blade binder levels for determining the hardness of this armor and the size of his armor health pool.

#### Armor Improvement (Su)  

At 5th level, the blade binder gains 3 armor improvements, allowing him to further customize his summoned armor. A blade binder must choose to apply an armor improvement at the time of summoning. A blade binder may only have a maximum of 1 armor improvement  plus an additional armor improvement for every 4 levels of blade binder you possess (to a maximum of 6 blade improvements) applied to a single summoned armor. A summoned armor with a armor improvement treats each armor improvement as a +1 bonus worth of magic armor special ability (+2 or more if a armor improvement counts as more than one armor improvement). If a armor possesses any magic armor special abilities from enhancement seals applied to the armor, in addition to the armor improvements applied to the armor, beyond +5 are suppressed until the total magic armor special abilities plus the armor improvements are equal to or lower than +5.

At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter the blade binder gains an additional armor improvement. If an armor improvement calls for a save attack the save attack is made at 1d20 + ½ MPB + Psyche modifier. They may add the enhancement bonus of their armor to this save attack.

For a complete listing of armor improvements, see Table - Armor Improvements.

#### Binder’s Resilience (Ex)  

At 7th level, the blade binder becomes more attuned to his summoned equipment, making it difficult to harm them or separate him from them. The binder gains a +2 competence bonus against sunder attempts against his summoned weapons and armor, as well as a +2 competence bonus against disarm attempts against his summoned weapons. At 12th level and every 6 levels thereafter the blade binder improves these competence bonuses by 1.

#### Master Binder (Su)  

At 15th level, the blade binder’s weapons and armor become equipment of legend. The blade binder may spend 1 additional Ki point as part of summoning his weapons to cause them to ignore a number of points of DR a creature possesses equal to 1 + 1 per 5 blade binder levels.

He may also spend 1 additional Ki point as part of summoning his armor to cause all armor he summons to provide him with DR 1/- improving by 1 per 5 blade binder levels; this DR stacks with other sources of DR the blade binder might possess.

In addition a number of times per day equal to half the blade binder’s Psyche modifier (minimum 1); the blade binder may spend 2 Ki points as a reaction at the start of his turn to double these bonuses until the start of his next turn.

#### Reality Sphere (Su)  

At 20th level, the binder’s source of power for his bound equipment grows to such power it becomes its own plane of existence. This plane of existence is a looping plane (causing creatures to loop around upon reaching the edges) of about 1 mile wide. The view and theme of the inside is the choice of the blade binder, but usually reflects his source of power and his specializations. Time here flows normally and is always hospitable for the blade binder.

The blade binder may transport himself here by spending 1 stamina as a full-round action which provokes attacks of opportunity. While in this area he may meditate for 1 hour. Upon finishing his meditation he becomes more aligned with his source of power allowing the blade binder to treat his MPB as 4 higher for the purposes of determining the power of any of his blade binder class features, as well as an additional blade and armor improvement. In addition, while in this sphere the blade binder reduces the cost of all his abilities that cost Ki points by 1 (minimum 0). This bonus lasts until the blade binder rests and regains stamina. The blade binder may spend a full-round action to return from his sphere, which always returns him to the point he entered his sphere from; this does not cost him a stamina to leave his sphere.

The blade binder may bring 1 adjacent creature along to this plane as part of the same full-round action; but doing so requires a Mental save attack roll (1d20 + ½ blade binder level + Psyche modifier) They may add the enhancement bonus of a wielded weapon to this save attack. On a success the creature is brought to this sphere with him. The creature only remains within this sphere for 1 round per blade binder level, and it may attempt a new Mental save against the original save attack each round as a move action to attempt to force itself out of this sphere.

## List - Binder Specializations

#### Armor Binder

**Prerequisites**: None

**Benefit**: The blade binder gains the summon armor class feature at 1st level, and the armor improvement class feature at 3rd level. The blade binder instead gains the summon weapon and blade improvement class features at 5th level. The blade binder may not select specializations that require summoned weapon until he gains summon weapon at 5th level. The blade binder may use stamina in place of any ability that requires ki for summon armor until he gains a ki pool at 3rd. At 5th level, and every 5 levels thereafter, the blade binder may divert a blade improvement to apply an additional armor improvement, allowing them to reduce how many blade improvements they may have active on any weapon at once while boosting the number their armor may possess.

##### Power Armor

**Prerequisites**: Blade Binder 3rd; Armor Binder or Summon Armor

**Benefit**: The blade binder gains an enhancement bonus to all strength and Agility based skill checks, and MSB and Physical(Str) checks for all reposition or grapple combat maneuvers equal to his summoned armor’s enhancement bonus. In addition the blade binder adds half his armor’s strength rating value to all damage rolls with melee weapons; at 8th level the binder instead adds all of his armor's strength rating; this does not apply to the strength rating increases for lacking proficiency in an armor.

#### Blade Spirit

**Prerequisites**: Blade Binder 3rd, Summon Weapon

**Benefit**: Your power begins to take on a mind of its own, gaining minor sentience. The blade binder gains a companion as described on the companion page treating his levels in blade binder as spell prowess bonus to determine the progression of this companion (and stacks with spell prowess bonus gained from other sources).

The companion gained this way must select the avian, quadruped, serpentine, or vermin base form. It gains the celestial, fiendish, demonic, or anarchic type as it’s companion type. The companion gains these types and talents even if the blade binder does not meet the prerequisites.

When the blade binder summons a piece of equipment he may choose to spend an additional ki point to summon this companion wielding the chosen piece of equipment. The companion is automatically proficient with the piece of equipment and may wield the weapon without issue. If the creature has a second limb capable of wielding weapons the blade binder may summon two weapons onto the weapon as normal. While wielding the binder’s summoned weapon the equipment does not disappear from not being wielded by the blade binder.

The summoned companion lasts until the blade binder rests to regain stamina. Once slain the creature may not be re-summoned for the remainder of the day until he rests unless the blade binder spends 1 stamina to summon it again, but with only half its total hit points. The blade binder’s companion disappears after 1 round if it goes beyond 30 feet + 5 feet per 2 blade binder levels.

##### Improved Blade Spirit

**Prerequisites**: Blade Spirit Specialization, Blade Binder 8th

**Benefit**: You and your blade spirit become of one mind, granting the binder full sensory input from it while it is summoned. While in range of the blade binder he may telekinetically give commands to his blade spirit and direct it as necessary with no additional actions required. In addition the blade spirit may now remain up to 100 feet + 10 feet per blade binder level from the blade binder before being at risk of disappearing.

##### Greater Blade Spirit

**Prerequisites**: Improved Blade Spirit Specialization, Blade Binder 13th

**Benefit**: You learn to assume direct control of your blade spirit as a full-round action. While in direct control your companion becomes a mirror of your inner self, gaining a copy of any combat or martial feats that you possess; the companion loses access to any combat or martial feats it possesses while being directly controlled by the blade binder, but may retain a number equal to the blade binder’s Psyche modifier (to a maximum of 1 per 4 blade binder levels). While assuming direct control the blade binder may not take actions and is flat-footed, but is otherwise aware of nearby dangers; during this time the binder controls and directs the blade spirit on the spirit’s turn. The blade binder may choose to end the direct control as a free action on his turn. Once the control ends the spirit returns to normal and begins taking its own actions again.

##### Master Blade Spirit

**Prerequisites**: Blade Spirit Specialization, Blade Binder 18th

**Benefit**: You may spend 2 ki points as a standard action to cause an existing blade spirit companion to become empowered. For 1 minute the companion gains a bonus to attack rolls equal to the blade binder’s Psyche modifier (to a maximum of 1 per 4 blade binder levels), as well as an enhancement bonus to all its physical attributes equal to any enhancement bonus his summoned equipment possesses.

**Special**: The binder may activate this ability as part of assuming direct control if he possesses the Greater Blade Spirit specailization.

#### Elemental Shape

**Prerequisites**: Summon Weapon

**Benefit**: Upon selecting this specialization the blade binder selects a single element from Water, Fire, Cold, Earth, Electric, Or Wind. The blade binder gains the ability to shape his weaponry with this element attuning his equipment to the chosen element. When using his summon weapon ability the blade binder’s summoned weapons deal additional damage equal to his Psyche modifier (maximum 1 per blade binder level) of his chosen element’s type and is multiplied on a crit. Unlike blade improvements the blade binder’s weapons are always summoned with this ability, though he may spend a reaction to suppress this ability on a single summoned weapon he is wielding for 1 minute.

##### Elemental Manifestation

**Prerequisites**: Elemental Shape, Blade Binder 3rd

**Benefit**: The blade binder learns to manifest his chosen element from his elemental shape ability in two different ways:

**Elemental Shroud**: The blade binder can spend a Ki point as a reaction to empower his currently summoned weapon to become shrouded in elemental power, dealing an additional 1d6 damage of his chosen element, improving by an additional 1d6 at 5th level and every 5 thereafter; this effect lasts a number of rounds equal to the blade binder’s Psyche modifier.  

**Elemental Blast**: The blade binder learns to summon his element into an elemental blast. The blade binder may spend 1 Ki point as a standard action to make a Physical(Agi) save attack against all creatures within a line, cone, or burst A successful save attack deals 1d6 damage per 2 MPB, while a failed save attack deals half damage. At 5th level a blade binder can spend 1 additional Ki point when using this ability to improve the damage to 1d6 per MPB. They may add the enhancement bonus of their summoned weapon to this save attack.

Shape

Size

Line

15 feet + 5 feet per 2 blade binder levels

Cone

10 feet + 5 feet per 2 blade binder levels

Burst(Centered on the blade binder)

10 feet + 5 feet per 4 blade binder levels

##### Condensed Elemental Blade

**Prerequisites**: Elemental Manifestation, Blade Binder 8th

**Benefit**: The binder learns to focus his energies, causing his weapon to become both an object of the ki point and of elemental energy. The binder learns to summon a special scabbard for his summoned weapons. The blade binder may only have one of these special scabbards summoned at one time, and this scabbard counts against his summoned weapon limit.

The binder may spend 2 ki points as part of sheathing a summoned melee weapon within this special scabbard; once within the scabbard the weapon must remain within it for 8 hours before it is drawn again, if drawn early the weapon remains unchanged and the blade binder must pay 2 Ki points to restart the process. If the weapon remains within the scabbard for 8 hours it becomes a condensed elemental blade.

When a condensed elemental blade is first drawn from its scabbard it releases a large wave of energy as if the blade binder had used the elemental blast ability from his elemental manifestation specialization; the binder may spend a Ki point to improve the elemental blast’s damage. Once drawn the condensed elemental blade lasts for 1 minute per blade binder level before the energies dissipate and the weapon returns to a normal summoned weapon.

The condensed elemental blade when drawn takes on an appearance of a solid weapon whose edges wave and crackle with elemental energies making it seem both solid and immaterial at once.  While in this form the blade binder may freely reshape this weapon into a different weapon he is proficient with, and may add or remove weapon special features (such as reach, brace, and blocking) despite the weapons current form. The condensed elemental blade may only add or remove a total number of weapon features on this condensed blade equal to 1 + 1 per 5 blade binder levels.

In addition while in this form the elemental blade deals dealing an additional 1d6 for every 4 blade binder levels he possesses, as well as dealing an additional number of points of elemental damage equal to his blade binder level; the blade binder may apply elemental shroud to this weapon as normal.

##### Condensed Elemental Armor

**Prerequisites**: Condensed Elemental Blade, Summon Armor, Blade Binder 13th

**Benefit**: The blade binder learns to create his armor out of the same condensed elemental energies, using it to create a more flexible form of armor that both protects and helps push his abilities even further. The blade binder may spend 2 ki points to summon a new set of armor of a type he is proficient in, or transform his existing armor into the condensed elemental form. While wearing the condensed elemental armor the blade binder gains an enhancement bonus to his Strength and Agility equal to 1 + the enhancement bonus of his summoned armor, as well as a 10 enhancement bonus + 10 per +1 enhancement bonus of his armor, to his movement speed. In addition the blade bidner gains Resist equal to the armor’s enhancement bonus against his chosen element.

   The armor lasts 1 round per blade binder level before the armor dissipates turning into normal armor of its summoned type. The blade binder must wait 8 hours before using this ability again. The binder may not use this ability while fatigued.

#### Enhancer

**Prerequisites**: None

**Benefit**: The blade binder may channel his energies into an existing piece of equipment he is currently wielding. By spending the same cost to summon a weapon or armor he may cause a single piece of equipment to attain any enhancement bonus his summon weapon ability would allow. Due to the strengthening nature of this ability, the blade binder may enhance items that normally aren’t meant to be weapons, allowing him to treat himself as proficient with a improvised weapon he has enhanced; the improvised weapon is still treated as improvised for the purposes of feats and abilities that interact with improvised weapons. As part of using this ability the blade binder may choose to allow the weapon to have blade improvements applied to it; but when doing so is subject to the same restrictions as blade improvements as normal. This enhancement lasts until the blade binder rests to regain stamina or when the weapon leaves his possession for more than 1 round. Weapons enhanced this way are otherwise treated as summoned weapons while they are enhanced for the purposes of interacting with other blade binder abilities.

#### Implement Binder

**Prerequisites**: Blade Binder 3rd, Summon Weapon

**Benefit**: You tap into the elemental energies of magic to turn your summoned weapon into an implement. When summoning an implement the weapon takes the form of a quarterstaff, but otherwise is treated as a casting implement. A summoned implement allows the blade binder rudimentary casting, treating the implement as possessing the extra affinity special ability of his chosen elemental energy source. In addition the staff is treated as having the extra spell special ability, treating his BCB as equal to half his levels in blade binder, allowing him to cast while holding the implement. The blade binder may use his stamina pool to pay any spell point costs for this talent. The blade binder may spend one week in a ritual to re-attune himself to a new affinity and spell, changing out what affinity talent and spell his implement gains.

Any enhancement bonus your summoned weapon grants applies to the implement and any spells cast with it.

##### Improved Implement Binder

**Prerequisites**: Implement Binder, Blade Binder 8th

**Benefit**: The blade binder may now create an additional implement with a new affinity talent and spell that he has not already selected with Implement Binder. When summoning an implement he may now choose which of these implements he is summoning. He may also have two implements summoned at once now, but each must have a different affinity talent and spell applied. At 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter the blade binder gains a new implement with a new affinity talent and spell; but is still limited to only two implements at a time.

##### Greater Implement Binder

**Prerequisites**: Improved Implement Binder, Blade Binder 13th

**Benefit**: The blade binder may now treat his BCB as equal to ¾ of his level in blade binder with spells cast through his implements. In addition each of his implements summon with the extra talent or extra spell special ability, which does not count against any blade improvements he may apply. The blade binder must select which special ability and granted spell or talent is applied to each implement, and once chosen cannot be changed without the re-attunement process of the implement binder ability.

#### Offensive Summon

**Prerequisites**: Summon Weapon

**Benefit**: You may summon your equipment in a way that turns them into a dangerous projectile. When using your summon weapon ability you may make a ranged attack roll against a foe within 30 feet. The foe takes the weapon damage plus his Psyche modifier in damage. For the purposes of interaction with feats and abilities the blade binder may treat this as the focused attack action. The blade binder may not use this with abilities that reduce the action cost of summon weapon below a standard action. The summoned weapon lasts the normal duration before disappearing after using this ability.

##### Improved Offensive Summon

**Prerequisites**: Offensive Summon, Blade Binder 8th

**Benefit**: The blade binder may use the Offensive summon ability as a full-attack action. When using this ability the binder summons as many weapons up to the maximum he may make as part of the full attack, but only pays the ki point cost of the summoning for the first weapon summoned this way. Additional weapons summoned after the first immediately disappear. This ability may not be used with two-weapon fighting.

##### Binder’s Mark

**Prerequisites**: Offensive Summon, Blade Binder 13th

**Benefit**: The binder learns to leave a trace of his power on his foes. Once per round when the blade binder succeeds on a attack roll against a foe using a summoned weapon he may spend a Ki point as an reaction to make a Resilience save attack against the foe he struck (1d20+ ½ MPB + Psyche modifier) the blade binder may add his summon weapon’s enhancement bonus to this save attack. If successful the target gains 2 marks, plus an additional mark per degree of success. If he fails by one degree or less he applies one mark to the target.

As a standard action the blade binder may cause these marks to erupt, forcing weapons to be summoned from within the target, damaging them. When causing the marks to erupt the creature takes 1d10 + Psyche modifier damage per every mark on the target. All marks are removed from the target once they have erupted.

#### Quartermaster

**Prerequisites**: Summon Weapon

**Benefit**: You may choose when summoning a weapon to make it a stable weapon capable of existing away from you longer than normal; these weapons now last 1 minute per blade binder level after leaving your possession, allowing you to create weaponry for your allies; weapons created with this ability cannot have blade improvements applied to them. Creatures can still detect the conjured, impermanent nature of the weaponry with a DC 10 Appraise or Profession(Blacksmith) check. The blade binder may spend an additional stamina when summoning this equipment to summon it directly within an ally’s hands within 30 feet + 5 feet per 4 blade binder levels. At 3rd level, the blade binder may use Ki in place of stamina when using this ability.

##### Improved Quartermaster

**Prerequisites**: Quartermaster Specialization, Blade Binder 8th

**Benefit**: When making stable weapons with the quartermaster ability the blade bidner may apply a single blade improvement to the created weapons with a blade binder level requirement of 4 or lower.

#### Telekinetic Orbit

**Prerequisites**: Summon Weapon

**Benefit**: The blade binder gains telekinetic aura with the telekinetic orbit talent as a natural spell using his class level as his BCB, his MPB as his SPB, and his Psyche as his CAM. You may cast this as a reaction on his turn, and may spend stamina in place spell points when using this. Unlike normal, the blade binder may choose to wield weapons within his orbit, but only as long as the items remain within his square; using his statistics as normal for making attack and damage rolls with such weapons. At 3rd level the blade binder may spend ki in place of stamina when using this ability. The blade binder may only use this orbit  with his summoned weapons and may summon his weapons directly into his orbit. At 5th level this natural spell gains the greater orbit talent and treats his reach as 5 feet longer for weapons wielded in his orbit.

**Special**: Shields in orbit do not provide their shield bonus to AC while in orbit and must be wielded directly by the blade binder to grant this benefit.

#### Telekinetic Equipment

**Prerequisites**: Summon Weapon

**Benefit**: The blade binder gains telekinetic throw with the distant lift talent as a natural spell using his BAB as his BCB, his MPB as his SPB, and his Psyche as his CAM. The blade binder may spend stamina in place of spell points when using this, but reduces the spell point cost of the spell by 1 (minimum 0). The blade binder may only lift and throw weapons his summoned weapons, and may choose to throw a weapon with this as part of summoning it as long as he spends at least a standard action to do so. Attacks with this are still treated as attack actions, or full attacks when throwing more than one, for the purpose of interaction with feats and abilities. At 6th level the balde binder may summon a number of weapons up to the maximum he may throw with telekinetic throw, while also not exceeding his summon weapon limit, as part of a full-attack action with telekinetic throw; rather than the normal cost to summon the blade binder instead need only pay 2 ki points to use this ability.

The blade binder is considered to have had a summoned weapon in his possession until the start of his next turn for the purpose of the weapon disappearing if he throws it with this ability, allowing him to continually re-throw the same weapon without requiring re-summoning.

**Special**: If the blade binder possesses the Telekinetic Orbit specialization he may wield weapons within the greater orbit range, not just weapons adjacent to himself. In addition he may choose to use his normal attributes or his Psyche modifier for attack and damage rolls for weapons wielded in his orbit. Weapons in his orbit are treated as having a reach equal to your own, calculated from the square the weapon occupies, for the purposes of making attacks of opportunity with such weapons.

##### Improved Telekinetic Equipment

**Prerequisites**: Telekinetic Equipment Specialization, Blade Binder 8th

**Benefit**: In addition when taking the full attack action with his telekinetic equipment he may make one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus.

**Special**: If the blade binder is using Telekinetic Orbit, he gains a number of additional reactions per round equal to his Psyche modifier, but these additional reactions may only be spent on attacks of opportunity for weapons within his orbit.

Abilities with the same name from other martial classes count towards this progression (ie taking extra martial feat from fighter, and then extra martial feat from barbarian would not grant you 4 martial feat it would grant you 3, and 2 more the next time you take it on either class.)                  |
| Floating Shield                     | Telekinetic Orbit, Blade Binder 4th           | Shields wielded by telekinetic orbit grant their shield bonus to the blade binder, but only while in the blade binder's square.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
